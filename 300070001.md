# Data-Unbundling-Project <a id="1"/>

I am a [Dings-Sub-Project](300000033.md).

## Problem-Statement <a id="1000"/>

Currently Programs like [Gimp](9000053.md) use [File-Formats](9000193.md) to store [Big-Data](9000049.md) together with [Modifictions](600164.md) in one single [Project-File](404.md).

On the one Hand this provides some Convenience for the User, but on the Other also comes with Drawbacks.

### Duplication of Data and Work <a id="1010"/>

When one Source-File is used in multiple Projects, it is duplicated in every Project-File, which brings serveral Drawbacks:

- Duplicate Work: When the Source-File is changed, it has to be updated in every Project-File.
- Duplicate Storage: For n Projects each Source-File is stored n Times and therefore requires n Times the [Storage](9000020.md).

### Problems with Version-Control-Systems <a id="1020"/>

- Each small Change in the Project updates the (often binary) Project-File and therefore n Changes require n Times the Storage in a [Version-Control-System](9000005.md).

## Solution <a id="2000"/>

One Solution for the described Problems would be the Unbundling of the Source-Files from the Modifications.
