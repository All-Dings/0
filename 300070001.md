# Audience-Inclusion-Project <a id="1"/>

The Audience-Inclusion-Project is a [Dings-Sub-Project](300000033.md) for the [Realization](600033.md) of [Audience-Inclusion-Movies](600146.md) and other similar Projects.

## Problem-Statement <a id="1000"/>

The [Audience](600146.md) is an *essential* [Part](60084.md) of an [Event](600085.md), that in our modern World always (at least) has two Aspects:

- [Live-Event](600209.md)
- [Recorded-Event](600211.md)

But both Aspects have their [Justification](), e.g. the Audience of the Live-Event:

Live-Experience

- Be in the unique Moment
- Have complete Focus on the Event

Recorded-Experience:

- Remember the Event for the Live-Audience
- Share the Experience with Friends and Family
- Actors can Experience what the Audience saw


## Risk-Analysis <a id="2000"/>

Theses two Aspects have (Somtimes conflicting) [Goals](60058.md), regarding [Attention](60175.md) or [Quality](600120.md), because as known from [Physics](10000000.md) each [Measurement](10000022.md) always influences a [System](10000068.md).

## Solution

Influence must not always be Disturbacnce
