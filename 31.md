# Markdown

The Markdown Language has been created by [John Gruber](30.md) and Aaron Swartz in 2004.

## Images

Since Markdown does not allow us to specify the Image Size, we use [HTML]() for the time beeing.

- alt: This can be shown when the Image can't be displayed, e.g. for Text Readers.
- style: We mostly use 256 [Pixels]() for "width" and calculate the required "height" Value.

Since we don't have a better solution for our [Simple Mouse]() we use this Workaround:

<img src="577.jpg" alt="Simple Mouse" style="height: 256px; width:256px;"/>

```
<img src="577.jpg" alt="Simple Mouse" style="height: 256px; width:256px;"/>
```
