# Markdown

The Markdown Language has been created by [John Gruber](30.md) and Aaron Swartz in 2004.

## Media-Files

We use the following Markdown-Tag for Media-Files:

```
![CAPTION](MEDIA-FILE)
```

For our [Simple Mouse](404.md) the following Code ...

```markdown
![Simple Mouse](577.jpg)
```

... leads to this Output:

![Simple Mouse](577.jpg)
