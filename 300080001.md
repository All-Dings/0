# Audience-Inclusion-Project <a id="1"/>

The Audience-Inclusion-Project is a [Dings-Sub-Project](300000033.md) for the [Realization](600033.md) of [Audience-Inclusion-Movies](300080002.md) and other similar Projects.

## Problem-Statement <a id="1000"/>

The [Audience](600146.md) is an *essential* [Part](60084.md) of every [Event](600085.md), which can be consumed in our modern World often in two different Flavours:

- [Live-Event](600209.md)
- [Recorded-Event](600211.md)

Both Aspects have their [Justification](600178.md) for the Audience of the [Live-Event](600209.md)&nbsp;...

- Enjoy the unique Moment.
- Provide complete Focus on the Event.

... as well as for the Audience of the [Recorded-Event](600211.md):

- Share the Experience with [Friends](180000002.md) and [Family](180000008.md).
- Allow the [Actors](202000010.md) to enjoy the Experience of the [Audience](600146.md).
- Allow Everybody to enjoy the Event multiple Times.

## Risk-Analysis <a id="2000"/>

The two Aspects have (Somtimes conflicting) [Goals](60058.md), for Example regarding [Attention](60175.md) or [Quality](600120.md), because as known from [Physics](10000000.md) each [Measurement](10000022.md) always influences the measured [System](10000068.md).

## Current Solution

In Order to keep the [Disturbance](600212.md) for the Live-Event at a [Minimum](12000061.md), most of the Time the [Focus](60143.md) of the Recording is on the [Actors](202000010.md), which waste a Lot of [Potential](60128.md), because the [Influence](600126.md) of the [Audience](600146.md) often comes up short.

## Proposed Solution <a id="2000"/>

Provide [Recording-Devices](20000024.md) also to the [Audience](600146.md), that uses them with a [Maximum](12000062.md) of [Mindfulness](41000010.md).

### Noise-Disturbance <a id="2010"/>

To prevent [Noise-Disturbance](290000001.md) the well-known [Flight-Mode](20000026.md) should be enabled, but keep in Mind, that this also disables your [Network](9200000.md):

![Online/Offline-Mode](400000187.jpg)

### Light-Disturbance <a id="2020"/>

To prevent [Light-Disturbance](290000003.md) for the general Use of a [Smpart-Phone](20000005.md), the [Dark-Mode](20000025.md) should be enabled:

![Bright/Dark-Mode](400000186.jpg)

To prevent [Light-Disturbance](290000003.md) when recording a [Video](200300000.md) or making a [Photo](50000001.md) with your [Smpart-Phone](20000005.md), the [Brightness-Level](10000117.md) should be reduced:

![Max/Min-Brightness](400000185.jpg)

## Show-Stoppers <a id="3000"/>

And of course we should follow the [Rules](60053.md), because otherwise [Legal-Actions](670039.md) could threaten us&nbsp;-&nbsp;So better respect the [Agb](680004.md):
