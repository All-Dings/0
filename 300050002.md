# Local-Web-App-Patent <a id="1000"/>

The Local-Web-App-Patent is a [Dings-Patent](300000030.md) of [Michael_Holzheu](0.md).

Status: <font color="red">Draft</font>

## Abstract <a id="1600"/>

This Patent describes the [Local-Web-App](300050003.md), which can easily installed and run on all [Devices](20000000.md) that provide a [Web-Browser](9000128.md) with [Java-Script](9010007.md) Support.

## Problem <a id="1100"/>

Currently the [Providers](600086.md) of [Computers](20000003.md) and [Smart-Phones](20000005.md), like [Google](240000009.md), [Apple](240000003.md) or [Amazon](240000004.md), are very restrictive, which [Apps](9000168.md) are allowed to be installed. Different [App-Stores](2000225.md) are used, where high [Fees](404.md) are charged in many Cases.

To make Matters worse, [Developers](404.md) have to learn *different* [Programming-Languages](9010000.md), like [Java](9010007.md) or [Swift](404.md) and develop their [Apps](9000168.md) multiple times.

## Solution <a id="1200"/>

To solve this [Problems](600029.md) there are several [Mulit-Platform](404.md)-Sulutions, like [Kivy](9000166.md), [Flutter](9000181.md) or [Unity](9000180.md), which try their Best to make the [Life](60064.md) of [Developers](404.md) easier, with more or less [Success](60139.md).

### Single-File <a id="1210"/>

The [Local-Web-App](300050003.md) provides a simple [Solution](600024.md) for the [Problem](600029.md) by using a single [Html-File](9000134.md), where all required [Data](60001.md) is inlined.

To achieve this [Goal](60058.md) the following existing [Technologies](60044.md) are used:

- Inline [Css](9000135.md)-Files for Styling the App.
- Inline [Java-Script](9010007.md)-Files for Programming the App.
- Inline all Kinds of [Binary-Files](404.md) and [Media-Files](30010000.md), like [Mp3](30010008.md), [Jpg](30010004.md) or [Mp4](30010009.md), by using [Encodings](60079.md) like [Base-64](2000226.md).
- Inline [Configuration-Files](9000173.md), like [Json](9200013.md)- or [Xml](9200012.md)-Files.
- Save [State](60069.md)-Information using [Local-Web-Storage](2000224.md).

This all together allows to provide a single [Html-File](9000134.md) that can downloaded on almost every [Device](20000000.md) while providing a high Amount of [User-Friendliness](404.md).

Because all required Data is stored on a [Local-File-System](9000025.md) the [App](9000168.md) can be used without [Network-Connection](404.md), which saves [Bandwidth](404.md)/[Energy](10000009.md) and as a Result reduces [Environment-Pollution](290000000.md).

### Multi-File <a id="1220"/>

Of course it is also possible to use multiple Files for the [Local-Web-App](300050003.md), which has the [Advantage](60172.md) that for [Updates](600131.md) only the changed [Files](9000007.md) have to be downloaded from the [Server](404.md).

But for the Time being the [Providers](600086.md) make the [Realization](600033.md) of this [Concept](600011.md) quite difficult, though not impossible.
