# Dings-Patent

A Dings-Patent is a [Patent](670022.md) in the [Dings-System](300000007.md).

## Termns and Condition

For each Dings-Patent the [Claim](130000040.md) is, that [I](0.md) had the [Idea](600012.md) at a given Time. I can prove this by the Use of a [Block-Chain](2000218.md), where currently the [Git-System](58.md) is used, as well as by Human-[Witnesses](11000004.md), who read the Patent.



Because I do not do a long Patent-Searches or Web-Searches, it is possible that Others had the same Idea earlier.
