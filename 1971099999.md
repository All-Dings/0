## Description <a id="1000"/> 

At the Age of 24, [Alan_Turing](70000010.md) published his [Famous_Paper](71000000.md) [On_Comutable_Numbers](71000002.md) in 1936.

There he first described his hypothetical [Turing_Machine](201000002.md), which is still an important Tool in theoretical [Computer_Science](9000000.md) Today.

This [Movie](700018.md) shows how the Machine works and also explains Turing's [Proof](600022.md) of [David_Hilbert](70000011.md)'s [Decision_Problem](600084.md).

###### Topics: Volume

Because some [Consumers](600076.md) complained that [Volume](404.md) of the Music is too high, I reduced it.
