# Flying-Services-Project <a id="1"/>

I am a [Dings-Sub-Project](300000033.md) for the [Realization](600033.md) of [Flying-Services](404.md).

## Version <a id="900"/>

Git-Version and History: <a href="https://github.com/All-Dings/0/commits/Master/300081001.md">https://github.com</a>

## Problem-Statement <a id="1000"/>

In order to provide Services, both the [Consumer](600076.md) and the [Provider](600086.md) have to come together in [Time](10000024.md) and [Space](10000050.md). Currently most of the Time the Consumer has to travel to the Provider, which has serveral Drawbacks:

- There are Consumers with limited Mobility, e.g. due to the Demographic-Factor there are more older People.
- Providing Production-Resources, e.g. Real-Estate or Equipment for the Services is associated with high Costs.
- The Utilization of Production-Resources is often suboptimal, e.g. at Holiday-Time Offices are not used.

Based on my own Considerations I identified [Potential](60128.md) for [Improvement](60135.md) in several Fields.

## Solution <a id="2000"/>

We provide [Flying-Services](404.md), where the Production-Resources are mobile:

- Motor-Homes
- Caravans
- Cars
- Motor-Bikes
- Bicycles

One single Resource can also be used for multiple Use-Cases, e.g. a Motor-Home can be equipped with a Wash-Basin for Hair-Styling or a Table for Massage. Humasn, who own Resources can rent them to other Service-Providers, when the Means-of-Production are currently not utilized, e.g. when a Caravan is not used for Vacation.

The [Communities](140000034.md) should provide Services, which can be rented by the Service-Providers for the Service-Time, for Example:

- Parking-Space
- Water-Supply
- Power-Supply

## Examples <a id="3000"/>

The proposed Concept can be applied to multiple Areas, where in the Following some of them are mentioned.

### Flying-Hair-Stylist <a id="3010"/>

### Flying-Teacher <a id="3020"/>

### Flying-Shaman <a id="3030"/>

### Flying-Masseur <a id="3040"/>

## Benefits <a id="4000"/>

### Resources <a id="4010"/>

A Booking-System is implemented in the [Dings-System](300000007.md), where the Service-Providers and Consumers can come together in the [Space-Time-Continuum](10000027.md)

For Example Service-Providers can document there in Advance at which Time a Service is Provided in which Area and the Service-Consumers can then book fitting Time/Space-Slots.

All Measures together will lead to better Rescource-Utilization and Cost-Reduction.

### Environment <a id="4030"/>

Instead of Traveling of multiple Consumers only one Provider has to move, which reduces for Example the [CO2](10100008.md)-Footprint and in Consequence to a Relief of the [Global-Warming](290000002.md).

### Real-Estate <a id="4040"/>

The Requirement of providing lot's of Buildings for Services is reduced.

## Risk-Analysis <a id="2000"/>

- Production-Resources of Others might not treated lovingly by the Service-Providers and Consumers.
- Common Real-Estate, e.g. Paring-Space is utilizated, which should somehow be compensated.
