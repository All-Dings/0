# The Big "Cleanup" Day

Blog-Chain-Time [2023.03.28-22:35](1100001.md) in [TÃ¼bingen](2000001.md), After Micha did the technical Work Yesterday, today our Creative Chief Officer [Michi](19.md) joined our Party to bring a bit more Pepper into the Souce.

But first I really want to beatify our [Work](99.md) a little bit.

So let's first check what we have written in the Document [^0] with the meaningful Number [99](1000000099.md), where obviously Somebody forgot to add a [Footnote](50003.md) for this famous saying:

```
But Caution is the Mother of the Porcelain Box, so let's make some Experiments first.
```

Our current Favourite [Markdown Footnotes](50001.md) have the Drawback that the [Numbers]() have to be specified manually, and to put it strait:

```
This can sometimes really be really be "Pain in the Ass"!
```

But before we can come back to that, we have first to define some basic [Things]. Oh Man, perhaps I should not have started that, because after ten Minutes I already created a long List of very important new Things.

But before I could commit those, we first had to define other even more urgent [Things](), namely [Michi](19.md), the simple [Show Mouse](577.md) and my [Bunnie Page]().

And there was a small Problem to enable the [Broken Link]() page - not a big deal, I will do that together with Micha sometime later [^1] .

But let's come back to the starting Point with the Footnotes. Obviously I had been a little bit too optimistic. Obviously on GitHub the modern fancy Features of the Markup Languate have not yet arrived. But this has time until Tomorrow.

So only one more Thing ...

Have a good Night!
