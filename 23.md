# About Alles

## XY Day

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.06-14:09 in Tübingen, I continue working on the Concept of Git-Sub-Modules.

First I change the Name of my Fork-Repository on Git-Hub from `COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole` to `888`.

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.06-18:12 in Tübingen, After some Experiments I decided to rename the Clash-of-Clans Upstream-Repository into "0" and move it into a new [Git-Hub-Organization](9000079.md) called `All-Dings`.

Then I deleted the old `888-Repository`, replaced it by a new one and changed the [Language](600041.md) from [German](600005.md) to [English](600006.md).

Since all these Operations have been a little bit dangerous, I now also disabled [Git-Force-Push](9000080.md) on Git-Hub for both Repositories to protect myself from doing silly Things.

Now I setup a Git-Sub-Module in the `888-Repository` for the moved `0-Repository`:

```console
18:10 $ git submodule add git@github.com:All-Dings/0.git
Cloning into '/Users/michael-holzheu/All-Dings/888/0'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 2538, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (934/934), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (395/395), done.
remote: Total 2538 (delta 512), reused 847 (delta 459), pack-reused 1604
Receiving objects: 100% (2538/2538), 6.43 MiB | 6.66 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (1304/1304), done
```

This creates a new [Sub-Directory](9000083.md) in the `888-Repository` that we can see with the [Unix-Ls-Command](9000081.md):

```console
18:31 $ ls -l
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  351 michael-holzheu  staff  11232  6 Apr 18:31 0
-rw-r--r--    1 michael-holzheu  staff     27  6 Apr 18:08 README.md
```

With the [Git-Status-Command](9000082.md) we see that besides of the `0-Directory` also a hidden File Named `.gitmodules` has been created:

```console
18:35 $ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   .gitmodules
	new file:   0
```

The [Unix-Cat-Command](9000040.md) shows us the Content of this File:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [main|●2] 
18:37 $ cat .gitmodules 
[submodule "0"]
	path = 0
	url = git@github.com:All-Dings/0.git
```

According to the very good [How-To](700022.md) [1] for Git-Sub-Modules, I now check what Git tells us about our new Sub-Module with the [Git-Diff-Command](9000084.md):

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [main|●2] 
18:52 $ git diff --cached  0
diff --git a/0 b/0
new file mode 160000
index 0000000..29783d2
--- /dev/null
+++ b/0
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+Subproject commit 29783d2cf991a95276404811054dcd640d77a733
```

We see that the Git-Commit `29783d2cf991a95276404811054dcd640d77a733` has been taken for the Sub-Module and with the `--submodule` Git-[Command-Option](9000085.md) we get all important Information about our new Sub-Module in one Summary:

```console
18:52 $ git diff --cached --submodule
diff --git a/.gitmodules b/.gitmodules
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..138b8ea
--- /dev/null

+       url = git@github.com:All-Dings/0.git
Submodule 0 0000000...29783d2 (new submodule
```

Now it is time to commit the Sub-Module to our `888-Repository` with the [Git-Commit](9000070.md)-Command using the `--all` and `--message` Options:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [main|●2] 
19:13 $ git commit --all --message "Add 0-Repository"
[main cca43ac] Add 0-Repository
 2 files changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitmodules
 create mode 160000 0
```

This created a new Commit that added the `0-Repository` as a Git-Submodule:

```console
19:14 $ git show

```

Finally I push the Commit to the remote `888-Repository` on Git-Hub:

```console
✘-128 ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 
19:22 $ git push origin Master
Enumerating objects: 4, done.
Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.

Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 375 bytes | 375.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To github.com:All-Dings/888.git
   f5b7a07..cca43ac  Master -> Master
```

On Git-Hub this looks then like the Following:

<img src="50000056.jpg" alt="First-Sub-Module" style="width:800px;"/>

To test what we have just created, we delete first our local Copy of the `888-Repository` ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings 
19:35 $ rm -rf 888/
```

... and then use the [Git-Clone](9000086.md)-Command to get a fresh Copy from Git-Hub:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings 
19:35 $ git clone git@github.com:All-Dings/888.git
Cloning into '888'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 9, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (9/9), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 9 (delta 0), reused 6 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (9/9), done.
```

With the Du-Unix-Command we see that the Size of the `888-Repository` with 128 Kilo-Byte is quite modest:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 
19:39 $ du -sh .
124K	.
```

This is because the Content of the `0-Repository` Sub-Module is not yet on our Disk-Drive:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 
19:39 $ ls 0/
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔]
```

For getting the Content of `0-Repository` we use the [Git-Sub-Module](9000087.md)-Init-Command, ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 
19:41 $ git submodule init
Submodule '0' (git@github.com:All-Dings/0.git) registered for path '0'
```

... followed by the Git-Sub-Module-Update-Command:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 
19:45 $ git submodule update
Cloning into '/Users/michael-holzheu/All-Dings/888/0'...
Submodule path '0': checked out '29783d2cf991a95276404811054dcd640d77a733
```

Now our Project consumes much more Space ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 
19:48 $ du -sh .
 13M	.
```

... and we can use the [Unix-Find-Command](9000088.md) to see our beloved Things form the `0-Repository` again:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 
19:54 $ find 0 | sort -V | head -7
0
0/.git
0/.gitattributes
0/.gitignore
0/0.md
0/1.md
0/2.md
```

Now it is time to add the first [Reference](60039.md) `Michael` from our `888-Repository` to the `0-Repository` Sub-Module ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 
20:11 $ printf "\nOn Monday, April-2023-03 Nicole and [Michael](0/0.md) visited the town of Metzingen to shop for some nice new Clothes." >> README.md
```

... and then commit and push the Result:

```
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master ↓·1|✚ 1] 
20:14 $ git commit -m "Add first Reference to 0-Repository" && git push
[Master 348b73d] Add first Reference to 0-Repository

```

Finally I click on the Git-Hub [Web-Site](9000089.md) on the new Reference `0/0.md` with the Name `Michael`, but real IT-Experts already know of course that this will not work:

### Footnotes

## Two Universes Day

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.05-15:42 in Tübingen, Today I would like to work again on a Concept for storing [Media-Files](30000000.md) efficiently in the Project:

My current Idea is to use [Git-Sub-Modules](9000063.md) for this Purpose.

### Create Git-Fork

For makeing some Tests I first create a [Git-Fork](9000064.md) of the original Ropository. First I create a Copy of the Repository:

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans$ cd ..
~$ cp -r Clash-of-Clans/ Clash-of-Clans-Fork
~$ cd Clash-of-Clans-Fork/
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$
```

I remove the [Git-Remote](9000065.md) "origin" from the Project:

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git (push)
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$ git remote remove origin
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$ git remote -v
```

I create on Git-Hub an empty new Repository with the Name "Clash-of-Clans-Fork" and then add its [URL](9000066.md) as Git-Remote to the Repository:

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$ git remote add Origin git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$ git remote -v
Origin	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git (fetch)
Origin	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git (push)
```

Then I use Git-Push to upload the Data to Git-Hub:

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$ git push --set-upstream Origin Master
Enumerating objects: 2249, done.), 604 KB | 0 B/s                                                                                                                                                                     
Counting objects: 100% (2249/2249), done.
Delta compression using up to 10 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (988/988), done.
Writing objects: 100% (2249/2249), 6.35 MiB | 3.78 MiB/s, done.
Total 2249 (delta 1154), reused 2054 (delta 1039), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1154/1154), done.
To github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git
 * [new branch]      Master -> Master
branch 'Master' set up to track 'Origin/Master'.
```

Because I want to use the Photos of Nicole in Metzingen for the first Sub-Module, I rename the Repository to ...

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$ cd ..
~$ mv Clash-of-Clans-Fork COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole
```

Then I add my Upsteam Git-Repository as a new Git-Remote:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git remote add Upstream git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git 
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git remote -v
Origin	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git (fetch)
Origin	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git (push)
Upstream	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git (fetch)
Upstream	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git (push)
```

Because I have committed already several Things to the [Upstream-Repository](404.md) the [Fork-Repository](404.md) is a little bit behind in History:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git log | head -11

And here as Reference the Upstream-Repository:

```console

    Add Git-Fork
```

We see that the last common Commit is the one with the [Hash-Value]() "97359863a670ffb1cb4aaaefe21fb4a90476368a". Therefore first I synchronize the backlevel COC-Metzingen-With-Nicole with the [Git-Fetch-Command](404.md):

```
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git fetch Upstream
remote: Enumerating objects: 33, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (33/33), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (29/29), done.
remote: Total 30 (delta 18), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (30/30), 7.72 KiB | 395.00 KiB/s, done.
From github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans
 * [new branch]      Master     -> Upstream/Master
```

Now all Information about the Upstream-Repository has been downloaded into the Fork-Repository. Next I use the [Git-Rebase-Command] to integrate the latest Changes from the Upstream-Repository's "Master" [Git-Branch](404.md) into my Fork-Repository "Master" Git-Branch:

```
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git rebase Upstream/Master
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/Master.
```

With the [Git-Log-Command](404.md) I now can see that ...

```

Date:   Wed Apr 5 18:01:21 2023 +0200

    Compare Git-Remotes
```

... the Upstream Repository has been modified in the Meantime again:

```
commit 939bd9c557542db053c9f9f5b014d46f2e41e8fc (HEAD -> Master, origin/Master, origin/HEAD)

Date:   Wed Apr 5 18:01:21 2023 +0200

    Compare Git-Remotes
```

Now the [Git-Heads](404.md) of both Repositories are at the same [Git-Commit](404.md) "939bd9c557542db053c9f9f5b014d46f2e41e8fc":

```
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git show

Date:   Wed Apr 5 18:06:24 2023 +0200

    Fetch from Upstream-Repository
```

Let's draw a short [Diagram](700021.md) to illustrate the current State:


```
|
+----- Add Diagram ba7f76bc3400deb31c390ae7a9b635c0db817264 (HEAD -> Master, origin/Master, origin/HEAD)

|
+----- Compare Git-Remotes
|

```

Now let's create a Directory and a [Landing-Page](700020.md) in the Fork-Repository. For this Sub-Project I use the Number 888:

```
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ mkdir 888

```

Then I create a [Landing-Page](700020.md) File with the Name "888.md":

```
# Metzingen with Nicole

I meet Nicole on 2003-04-02 in Metzingen to buy some new Cloths and make some Test-Photos for the "Clash-of-Clans" Project.
```

Because Metzingen is not yet defined in the Upstream-Repository, I create a new Thing with Number 140000010.md in my Fork-Repository.

To make Life a bit easier for me, I switch for a Moment I switch now completely to the Fork-Repository "COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole" ...

In my Terminal-Session I now go to my Directory "COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole" and fetch the current State from the Upstream-Repository:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git fetch Upstream
remote: Enumerating objects: 43, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (43/43), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (37/37), done.
remote: Total 39 (delta 24), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (39/39), 9.35 KiB | 398.00 KiB/s, done.
From github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans
   939bd9c..0f82393  Master     -> Upstream/Master
```

Then I rebase my local Fork-Repository to get all the Updates:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git rebase Upstream/Master
```

With the Git-Log Command I look at the current [Blog-Chain](300000000.md):

```console

Author: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
Date:   Wed Apr 5 19:51:42 2023 +0200

    Switch to Fork Metzingen-with-Nicole

```

Let's draw a new Diagram for the current State, where we realize that now the Fork-Repository is 4 Commits ahead of the Upstream-Repository:

```
+----- Add Metzingen (cd822cc8a33aea5054e2e1ab5852bf3b5c2d7d44 -> Fork-Repository)
|
+----- Add Metzingen
|
+----- Add Metzingen-with-Nicole
|
+----- Add Hash-Value
|
+----- Switch to Fork Metzingen-with-Nicole (0f82393eb01a1122cb3a062e43a4a616c3282ec5 -> Upstream-Repository)
|
```

To be not confused, I first rename the Git-Remote for my Fork properly:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git remote rename Origin Fork
Renaming remote references: 100% (1/1), done.
```

IMHO, now it's much more clear:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git remote -v
Fork	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git (fetch)
Fork	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git (push)
Upstream	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git (fetch)
Upstream	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git (push)

### Synchronize with Upstream-Repository 

Now let's try to move the new Stuff to the Upstream-Repository. This can be done by a [Git-Pull-Request](404.md).

For doing that we first need to create a new [Git-Branch](e9000069.md) from the last common [Git-Commit](9000070.md) that we already identified by its Hash-Value 0f82393eb01a1122cb3a062e43a4a616c3282ec5:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git branch PR-0-First-Sync 0f82393eb01a1122cb3a062e43a4a616c3282ec5
```

In our Diagram this then looks like the Following:

```
+----- Add Metzingen (cd822cc8a33aea5054e2e1ab5852bf3b5c2d7d44 -> Fork-Repository)
|
+----- Add Metzingen
|
+----- Add Metzingen-with-Nicole
|
+----- Add Hash-Value
|
+----- Switch to Fork Metzingen-with-Nicole (0f82393eb01a1122cb3a062e43a4a616c3282ec5 -> PR-0-First-Sync)
|
```

Now lets do a [Git-Checkout](9000071.md) of our new Git-Branch:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git checkout PR-0-First-Sync
Switched to branch 'PR-0-First-Sync'
```

Then let's check the Commits on this Branch:

```console
commit 0f82393eb01a1122cb3a062e43a4a616c3282ec5 (HEAD -> PR-0-First-Sync, Upstream/Master)
Author: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
Date:   Wed Apr 5 19:51:42 2023 +0200

    Switch to Fork Metzingen-with-Nicole

commit fbb3a86eacce71dc061f93913627a04a3f868078
Author: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
Date:   Wed Apr 5 19:49:01 2023 +0200

    Update
```

As expected that last Commit is our known [Fork-Point](404.md):

```console
commit 0f82393eb01a1122cb3a062e43a4a616c3282ec5 (HEAD -> PR-0-First-Sync, Upstream/Master)
Author: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
Date:   Wed Apr 5 19:51:42 2023 +0200

    Switch to Fork Metzingen-with-Nicole

commit fbb3a86eacce71dc061f93913627a04a3f868078
Author: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
Date:   Wed Apr 5 19:49:01 2023 +0200

    Update
```

To get the new Commits of the Master Git-Branch into our new Branch we use the Git-Rebase Command:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git rebase Master

Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/PR-0-First-Sync.
```

We now can see our last Work on the PR-0 Branch:

```console
commit 9f6f8056445caeef70d58c4b3daf58a9b84148a3 (HEAD -> PR-0-First-Sync, Fork/Master, Master)

    Add Reference
```

In order to see the Git-Branch on the [Bash-Prompt](9000072.md) I install ...

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ brew install bash-git-prompt
Running `brew update --auto-update`...
```

... and then add the following Lines to my [Bash-RC-File](9000073.md):

```console
if [ -f "$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/bash-git-prompt/share/gitprompt.sh" ]; then
     __GIT_PROMPT_DIR="$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/bash-git-prompt/share"
     source "$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/bash-git-prompt/share/gitprompt.sh"
fi
```

Then I enable the new Function with the [Bash-Source-Command](9000074.md) and now we can see the currenty active Branch and the Time in the Prompt: 

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ source ~/.bashrc
✔ ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [Master|✔] 
00:21 $
```

Now let's go again to the Pull-Request Branch ...

```console
00:29 $ git checkout PR-0-First-Sync
Switched to branch 'PR-0-First-Sync'
✔ ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [PR-0-First-Sync L|✔] 
00:29 $ 
```

... and get the latest Commits from the Master-Branch:

```console
00:30 $ git rebase Master
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/PR-0-First-Sync.
✔ ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [PR-0-First-Sync L|✔] 
```


Now let's Use the Git-Push-Command to publish the Branch on the Fork Remote:


```console
00:42 $ git push --all -u --set-upstream git@github.com:michael-holzheu/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole.git

branch 'PR-0-First-Sync' set up to track 'git@github.com:michael-holzheu/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole.git/PR-0-First-Sync'.

```

To create the Pull-Request, we first install the Hub-Extension:


```console
✔ ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [PR-0-First-Sync L|✔] 
00:47 $ brew install hub
```

First we have to configure ...

```
✘-1 ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [PR-0-First-Sync L|✔] 
01:22 $ cat ~/.config/hub
---
github.com:

```

Frist set the Master Branch back to the common Commit:


```console
✘-1 ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [PR-0-First-Sync L|✔] 
01:25 $ git checkout Master
Switched to branch 'Master'
✔ ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [Master L|✔]

Switch to the Pull-Request Branch again:


```console
01:26 $ git checkout PR-0-First-Sync
Switched to branch 'PR-0-First-Sync'
✔ ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [PR-0-First-Sync L|✔] 
```

Then finally create the Pull-Request:


```console
01:36 $ hub pull-request -b Master

Real Git-Experts of course know, that this did the wrong Thing, so I make it simple for Today and setup the Upstream-Branch properly ...

```console

With this I finish my little Journey between the Clash-of-Clans and COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole Universes.

Sleep well and keep your [Curiosity](60038.md)!

## Clash of Clans Day

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.03-16:56 on my Way to the Camera-Shop, I obviously forgot Something ...

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.03-18:36 on my Way to Nicole, Some new Concepts have to wait, beause ...

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.03-18:01 on my Way to Nicole, I obviously lost the best Photos from Yesterday ...

## The Beauty Day

### Simple Work

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.03-08:50 in Tübingen, I started to cleanup some Things:

```console
michael-holzheu@MacBook/Clash-of-Clans $ grep "Cat-Com" *.md
23.md:Before looking into that one, we copy the new [Code](9000039.md) into a separate File [Du-Script](9000038.bash) and check its [Content](600021.md) with the [Cat-Command](9000040.md):
9000040.md:# Cat-Command
9000040.md:The Cat-Command 
```

Though manually renaming Stuff means a lot of [Work](60036.md), for Wakeup in the Morning it has its [Beauty](60035.md) and somehow feels more like [Fun](60037.md).

After my simple [Work-Item](120000001.md) the [Indentation-Levels](700016.md) of all [Lines](700011.md) are fixed. 

### German Wireless-Problems

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.03-10:20 on my Way to Nicole, I continue to finish the Simple Work ...

Because the [Wireless-LAN](9000060.md) most of the Times does not work in German's [Auto-Buses](20000004.md), I switch to the [Git-Hub](9000061.md) online [User-Interface](9000062.md).

## An Original Day

### Sorted-Things

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.02-14:45 in Tübingen, I already created many Numbers for this Project and in order to not lose track of the Situation, I created a [List](60008.md) where the Things are [ordered](60010.md) more or less according their [Number](60000.md):

```console
$ head -n 4 Almost-Sorted-Things.txt 
30010003.md Pixel
30010002.md Full-HD
30010001.md Resolution
30010000.md Media-Formats
```

First I want to sort the List in the reverse Order:

```console
$ cat Almost-Sorted-Things.txt | sort -nr > Sorted-Things.txt
```

Next I would like to create a Markdown-Document with [Links](9000046.md) that is clickable:

```
$ cat Sorted-Things.txt | (while read Number Name; do printf "%-14s %-20s [Link](%s)\n" $Number $Name $Number; done) > SortedThingsWithMarkDown.md
```

Looks almost good, but some Things still have to be fixed manually, for Example:

```
12000000.md    Expert               [Link](12000000.md)
11091971.md    Michael's            [Link](Calendar)
11091971.md                         [Link]()              <====
11000000.md    History              [Link](11000000.md)
```

Afterwards I append the Result to the [README](README.md) File using the [MV-Command](9000046):

```console
$ cat README.md SortedThingsWithMarkDown.md > tmp.md
$ mv tmp.md README.md
```

To make the Links clickable, originally I have added all the Things into a Markdown-List:

---
- 1000000099.md  NinetyNine           [Link](1000000099.md)

- 30010003.md    Pixel                [Link](30010003.md)
- 30010002.md    Full-HD              [Link](30010002.md)
---

But somehow I don't like the [Layout](700017.md). For removing the Links again, I use the following VIM-Command:

```
:%s/\s\+\[Link.*//g
```

Now it looks like the Following:

---
- 1000000099.md  NinetyNine

- 30010003.md    Pixel
- 30010002.md    Full-HD
- 30010001.md    Resolution
---

To replace the leading Bullets, I enter the VIM-Visual-Mode with the Control-v [Keyboard-Shortcut](9000048.md), then remove the leading Bullets and finally I mark the whole Section with "```" as a [Markdown-Code-Block](40003101.md):

```
1000000099.md  NinetyNine

30010003.md    Pixel
30010002.md    Full-HD
30010001.md    Resolution
```

Now it looks fine for the Time beeing.

### Big Things (again)

Now I come back to my old Question, how to store big Files in this Project. After I having rejected the idea of using LFS, now another Idea came to my Mind.

What about storing the [Big-Data](9000049.md) seperate from the Not-So-Big-Data?

### Sample Image

I plan to test the new Concept with a Picture-for-Nicole:

<img src="55.jpg" alt="Picture-for-Nicole" style="width:600px;"/>

According my current Rules I stored it in Full-HD Resolution in my Clash-of-Clans [GIT-Repository](9000050.md), where all the Files together currently have the Size of about 4 Megabytes:

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans$ bash 9000038.bash | tail -n 2
README.md            3967 4121912
./2000002.md           34 4121879
```

The Byte-Size of our Picture in [JPG-Image-Format](30010004.md) is ...

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans$ ls -l 55.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  905873  2 Apr 19:08 55.jpg
```

If we divide the Size of 905.873 [Bytes](9000013.md) by 1024 we get around 900 [Kilo-Bytes](9000014.md).

Then I use the [Image-Editing](9000054.md) [Application](9000055.md) [Gimp](9000053.md) for converting the [Image](30000002.md) from compressed JPG-Image-Format into [RAW-Image-Format](30010005.md) and check its Byte-Size:

```console
~$ ls -l 55.raw 
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  29942784  2 Apr 21:08 55.raw
```

So now the same Picture in that [Format](60019.md) uses 29.942.784 Bytes or around 30 Mega-Bytes of my Disk-Drive.

Why is that?

### Compression

The Reason for the 29 Mega-Bytes Difference between JPG and RAW is [Compression](9000051.md): The JPG-Image-Format is highly compressed and still provides enough [Information](60007.md) for [Rendering](9000052.md) the Picture in a way that a [Human](40000001.md) can understand its [Meaning](60002.md).

The higher we make the [Compression-Level](9000057.md), the lower is the [File-Size](9000056.md):

```console
michael-holzheu@MacBook/55 $ ls -lS
total 72528
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  29942784  2 Apr 21:08 55.raw
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff   2382877  2 Apr 21:56 55-100.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff   2382877  2 Apr 21:56 55-80.jpg
-rw-r--r--@ 1 michael-holzheu  staff    905873  2 Apr 21:59 55-94.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    905873  2 Apr 21:56 55.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    243910  2 Apr 21:57 55-60.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    181193  2 Apr 21:57 55-40.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    118690  2 Apr 21:57 55-20.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff     50984  2 Apr 21:57 55-00.jpg
```

But the lower the Compression-Level, the lower is also the [Quality](60020.md):

<img src="50000055.jpg" alt="Picture-for-Nicole-with-JPG-Compression-Level-0" style="width:600px;"/>

But what does that mean?

### About Quality

Hmm, I somehow like the highly-compressed [Image](30000002.md), so probably we have to specify the Meaning of Quality a bit more.

For Example, when we get into the [Territory](600036.md) of [Fine-Arts](60000000.md), it is not so easy to measure the [Quantity](60021.md) of a [Picture](60000001.md).

In the [Context](600034.md) of [Photography](50000000.md) at first Glance it seems much simpler, because a [Photo](50000001.md) should come close to [Reality](40000.md). So in this Respect the higher compressed Image has less Quality.

And the highest Quality regarding Reality should have the [Orignal](60022.md), no?

### The Original

In Photography the "best" [Image-Format](30010006.md) regarding Quality is probably the uncompressed RAW-Image-Format, but for our Example this is a bit more complicated.

The Reason is that current [Smart-Phones](20000005.md) normally store the Photos already in JPG-Image-Format and this is also the case for our [Picture-for-Nicole](55.jpg).

When I convert the compressed Image back to RAW-Image-Format, we probably even loose Qualtiy because during the [Conversion](600037.md) Image-Information will be lost.

If we assume that by [Definition](13000002.md) the Original is the Image with the best Quality, by [Logic](600038.md) we can come to the [Conclusion](600027.md) that our the JPG-Image is original.

But wait ...

According to my [Rules](5.md) I already resized the Image to Full-HD Format, therefore the File in this Repository is *not* the Original.

So let's copy the "Original" into our Directory:

```console
michael-holzheu@MacBook/55 $ ls -lS
total 75288
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  29942784  2 Apr 21:08 55.raw

-rw-r--r--@ 1 michael-holzheu  staff     50984  2 Apr 21:57 55-00.jpg
```

With its 1,4 Megabytes in Terms of File-Size it lies beetween the two Full-HD Images with 80% and 94% Compression.

This sounds good at first glance, but now let's use the [Exif-Tool](9000059.md) to check the [Image-Size](30010007.md):

```console
michael-holzheu@MacBook/55 $ exiftool original_60bf61ca-6207-4ed8-a563-17186415691b_20230401_141946.jpg | grep "Image Size"
Image Size                      : 3648x2736
```

This means that we have a [Resolution](30010001.md) of 3648 Pixels for the [Width](10000005.md) and 2736 for the [Height](10000006.md).

So according to [Adam-Ries](70000001.md) who is a famous [Personality](70000000.md) in the [Discipline](7000003.md) of [Mathematics](13000000.md), we have in total ...

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans$ echo "... $((3648 * 2736)) Pixels."
... 9980928 Pixels.
```

Taking into account the File-Size of 1409592 Bytes, this means that one Pixel requires ...

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ echo "... $((1409592 / 9980928)) Bytes."
... 0 Bytes.
```

Obviously [Arithmethic](13000005.md) with more Quality is required here and we better use good-old [Floating-Point](13000004.md) to get some [Precision](10000007.md) into the [Calculation](13000003.md).

So let's switch from [Bash](34.md) to a [Computer-Language](9010000.md) with a little bit more [Functions](600039.md), namely ...

```
michael-holzheu@MacBook/55 $ perl -E "say 1409592 / 9980928"  
0.141228551092644
```

As a [Mathematician](80000002.md) this [Result](60033.md) reminds me to a [Famous-Number](13010000.md) but this is really pure [Coincidence](99.md).

Perhaps, perhaps not...

Wouldn't be [Life](404.md) without any [Secrets](https://www.holzheu.de/rumaenien-2018-teil-3#69mp3) a litte [Bit](75.md) too boring?

Keep your courious and sleep well!

## Big Data Day

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-15:15 in Tübingen, After I finished Tennis Training, good Lunch and Shopping, now it's Time to find a good Solution for storing Big Data, like Music, Pictures, and Movies.

Up to now my favourite Solution was Git's [Large Files Support](15.md#Large-File-Support), but I already made some [unpleasant](666.md) Experiences with that [Software](9000006.md).

Although I already [configured](15.gitconfig) the Stuff, it is no longer working. For some [Reason](600030.md) the [Files](9000007.md) are still uploaded directly into the "normal" Git Repository.

The most [likely](600031.md) Reason is that I deleted and cloned the [Repository](9000010.md) many Times and therefore Parts of the [Configuration](9000011.md) have been lost.

### Experiments

In Order not to mess up my Clash-of-Clans I first create a new Repository to play with. But before doing that, I first want to store an [Image](30000002.md) in the "normal" Clash-of-Clans.

#### Commit Screenshot to Git

It is a [Screenshot](30000001.md) in [Full-HD](30010002.md) that has the Size of 170777 Bytes or equivalent to 167 Kilobytes:

```console
$ ls -l 88.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  170777  1 Apr 16:37 88.jpg
$ ls -lh 88.jpg 
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff   167K  1 Apr 16:37 88.jpg
```
##### Repository Data-Size

But before [committing]() the File, first check the old [Data-Size](9000016.md) of the Repository, which is 19120 [Bytes](9000013.md) or equivalent (more or less) to 9,3 [Mega-Bytes](9000015.md):

```console
$ du -s Clash-of-Clans 
19120	Clash-of-Clans
$ du -hs Clash-of-Clans
9,3M	Clash-of-Clans
```

Oehm...

I noticed that is wrong with the above Values. One 9,3 

bytes are around 9,3 * 1.000 * 1.000 = 9.3000.000 Byte. But the "du -s" Command shows me only 9,3 Magabyte.

So what's the Problem?

As every [Expert](12000000.md) in [Informatics](9000000.md) knows, a [Disk-Drive](20000002.md) stores [Data](60001.md) in [Blocks](9000018.md) and the Usage of the [Device](20000000.md) is therefore also shown in that [Unit](10000003.md).

So to calculate the Usage in Bytes we first have to find out the [Block-Size](9000017.md):

```
$ diskutil info / | grep "Block Size"
   Device Block Size:         4096 Bytes
   Allocation Block Size:     4096 Bytes

$ $ stat -f %k .
4096
```

This means that one Block on [My-Mac-Book](2000002.md) has 4096 Bytes and therefore the Disk-Drive-Usage can be calculated with ...

```
$ echo "$((4096 * 19120))"
78315520
```

For [Verification]() we calculate the Size in Mega-Bytes with ...

```
$ echo "$((1000 * 1000))"
1000000

$ echo "$((78315520 / 1000000))"
78
```

Oehm ...

As we saw at the beginning the "du -sh" Command told us that the "Clash of Clans" [Directory](9000019.md) uses 9,3 Mega-Bytes of Disk [Storage](9000020.md). The Question is, how does that match to the 78 Mega-Bytes, we calculated by the Blocksize and the "du -s" Command?

Let's find first out the [Sum](3000001.md) of the [Byte-Sizes](9000021.md) of all [Files](9000007.md) in the Directory:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ ls

```

That's a lot of files ...

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ ls | wc -w
     165
```

Let's write a "short" [Script](9000023.md) that forms a [Sum](13000001.md) over all the File-Sizes:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ ls -l | tail -n +2 | (while read -r Line; do FileSize=$(echo $Line | awk '{print $5}'); FileName=$(echo $Line | awk '{print $9}'); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done)
0.md                  442   442
1.md                  228   670
100.md                130   800
10000.jpg           43265 44065
...
9000019.md             32 3194690
9000020.md             26 3194716
904.md                120 3194836
README.md             256 3195092
```

I realize that the Sum over all File-Sizes is 3195092 Bytes, or written different as 3.195.092 Bytes, respective around 3.195 Kilo-Bytes or 3 Mega-Bytes.

We saw above that the [DU-Command](9000028.md) with the [Command-Options](9000029.md) "-hs" tells me that the [Disk-Usage](9000027.md) is 9,3 Mega-Bytes, so where are the missing 6 Mega-Bytes?

Of course every good [Computer](20000003.md) Expert knows that most [Operating-Systems](9000030.md) provide [File-Systems](9000025.md), that provide [Hidden-Files](9000026.md).

Traditionally under [Unix](9000031.md) hidden Files begin with a Dot and with the so-called [Find-Command](9000032.md) we can show behind the Scenes and already the first Line of [Output](60017.md) shows the hidden [Pointer](9000033.md) "." to the current [Work-Directory](9000034.md).

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ find .
.
./50003.md
./100.md
```

Looking further down, we see the first "real" Hidden-File, namely ...

```
./20.md
./30.md
./.gitignore
```

BTW, the Data in the [Git-Ignore-File](58.md#git-ignore-file) defines all Files that should be ingored by the Git-Command.

But before we come back on that, let's rewrite our original Skript a bit and use the [Grep-Command](9000036.md), the [Stat-Command](9000037.md) plus some [Regular-Expressions](9000035.md) for the Calculation of the Disk-Usage:

```
$ find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done)
./50003.md            139   139
./9000025.md           36   175

...

./2.md                333 3198498
./2000002.md           34 3198532
```

Hmm, now we get 3198510 Bytes and the old Script calculated 3195092 Bytes, if I remember correctly, so thats ...

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$  echo "$((3195092 - 3198532)) Bytes less."
-3440 Bytes less.
```

Of course every real [Nerd](12000001.md) who thinks he's something in the Computing Area, knows of course that we created a lot of Files since we ran the old Script the last Time.

Before looking into that one, we copy the new [Code](9000039.md) into a separate File [Du-Script](9000038.bash) and check its [Content](600021.md) with the [CAT-Command](9000040.md):

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ cat 9000038.bash
# Du-Script

find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done)
```

As first [Test-Case](9000042.md) of the Script I run it with [Bash-](34.md) and the [TAIL-Command](9000041.md):

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ bash 9000038.bash | tail -n 2
./2.md                333 3198802
./2000002.md           34 3198836
```

Now let me run the Code again as [One-Liner](700012.md) and compare the Output:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done) | tail -n 2
./2.md                333 3198802
./2000002.md           34 3198836
```

Now I add the first One-Liner to my Du-Script and add the "tail -n 1" command to both Lines:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ cat 9000038.bash
# Du-Script

# First Script
ls -l | tail -n +2 | (while read -r Line; do FileSize=$(echo $Line | awk '{print $5}'); FileName=$(echo $Line | awk '{print $9}'); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done) | tail -n 1

# Second Script
find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done) | tail -n 1
```

So now when running the Script in [Theory](7000001.md) I would expect to see two Lines showing the same Result, so let's try it ...

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ bash 9000038.bash 
README.md             256 3201483
./2000002.md           34 3199246
```

To find out the [Reason](600030.md) for the [Problem](600029.md) some some [Debugging](9000044.md) is required. My first [Hypothis]() is that the second Script for why ever finds less Files that the first one.

And indeed, after I checked the List of [File-Types](9000045.md) and realized that three of them are missing, I add them to the second Script:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ git diff
diff --git a/9000038.bash b/9000038.bash
index 748352c..d175d9c 100644

 # Second Script
-find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done) | tail -n 1

```

Now I am confident that both Scripts will show the same Result now:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ bash 9000038.bash
README.md             256 3201540
./2000002.md           34 3201510
```

Oh Boy, still not finished, let's look at our Files again:

Finally I found the [Lazy-Egg](404.md) and renamed it:

```
$ git mv 700001 700001.md
$ git commit -m "Rename Document"
$ git push
```

Nice, but what has all this to do with "Clash of Clans"?

Will see ...

## Problems Day

### DB-Navigator Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-01:20, We looked up for a Train back to Tübigen and the DB-App shows me a possible Connection. Nice, so I can save the Money for the Taxi. After I waiting 20 Minutes on the Subway-Platform, I read the Timetable which then tells me that there are no more trains at this time.

So looks like this is a Problem with the [DB-Navigator](8009999.md).

### Samsung Pen Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-00:36, I show Nicole my Project and she suggests to use the Pen of my [Samsung-Galaxy-S22-Ultra](20000001.md) and test Handwriting. After 10 Minutes fighting with Problems we stopped the [Experiment](10010000.md).

### Electricity Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-22:18 on my Way to Nicole, This time I did not forget my Charging-Device for the MacBook and fortunately the [German-Federal-Raiload](8009999.md) provides [Electricity](10000001.md), Problem solved!

### Heil-und-Kostenplan Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-13:OO in Tübingen, I read an E-Mail from the [Singing-Dentist](404.md), where he points out that I have forgotten to bring the [Heil-und-Kostenplan](8000999.md#Heil-und-Kostenplan) as I promised.
 
In fact I was Yesterday Evening at the Dental-Practice. Before putting the Document into the Post-Box, I skimmed it a very last time. Then I noticed a yellow Label:

```
* Achtung
Sehr geehrter Patient!
Bitte diesen Heil- und Kostenplan
1. zusammen mit dem Bunusheft bei Ihrer Krankenkasse einreichen
2. nach Zuschussfestsetzung durch die Kasse den Antrag bitte umgehend an die Praxis zurück
```

Unfortunately I only read up to Line Number 4, and then concluded that I have taken the wrong Document. So unfortunatley the Way was for Nothing.

Back home I search for the "right" Document which I - by logical [Conclusion](600027.md) - cannot find.

I felt rememinded to my recently [lost Work](#about-trust). So I developted the [Hypothesis](600028.md) that I might have already delivered the Document. But then I checked my [Calendar](11091971.md) found out the [Truth](600021.md):

For the first Appointment I brought the wrong Document and I promised to deliver the right one for the next (second) Session. If my [Memory](600032.md) does not deceive me, I see almost 100% [Probablity](600031.md) that something must have gone wrong.

Therefore I now also read the 5th [Line](50010.md) and detected the [Reason](600030.md) for my [Problem](600029.md).

After that [Realization](600033.md) I grabbed the Heil- und Kostenplan, walked agein to the Dentist and put the Document into his Post-Box.

Problem solved!

## More Concepts Day

### Finished Work

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-23:25 still on my Way to Nicole, I finished the Work for Today, CU Tomorrow!

### About Apple Macbook Pro 14'' M1

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-23:17 still on my Way to Nicole, Not a good Time for the Project. Today, my MacBook seems to empty his Battery faster than expected ... 

### About Trust (again)

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-22:47 still on my Way to Nicole, Believe it or not my first Information Container Concepts have disappeared ...

### Information Containers

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-22:34 finally on my Way to Nicole, I start to add Concepts about Information Containers.

### About Trust

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-22:19 on my Way to Nicole, Believe it or not, but our Story about "Micha ... (again)" is lost somewhere in all this crazy mess.

### Add Theory

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-20:03 in Tübingen(TBD), Before starting the real work, I first want to summarize the [Theory](700001.md) into a List.

### Add History

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-13:27 in Tübingen(TBD), I decided to combine my first Days into this [Document](700001.md) for describing the [History](11000000.md) of this Project.

## First Concepts Day

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.29-17-25, I am on my Way to Nicole [1] and after the [Cleanup Work](100.md) Yesterday, now I would like to use the [Time](10000002.md) for adding some new [Concepts](600011.md).

## Big "Cleanup" Day

Blog-Chain-Time [2023.03.28-22:35](1100001.md) in [Tübingen](2000001.md), After Micha did the technical Work Yesterday, today our Creative Chief Officer [Michi](19.md) joined our Party to bring a bit more Pepper into the Souce.

But first I really want to beatify our [Work](99.md) a little bit.

So let's first check what we have written in the Document [0] with the meaningful Number [99](1000000099.md), where obviously Somebody forgot to add a [Footnote](50003.md) for this famous saying:

```
But Caution is the Mother of the Porcelain Box, so let's make some Experiments first.
```

Our current Favourite [Markdown Footnotes](50001.md) have the Drawback that the [Numbers]() have to be specified manually, and to put it strait:

```
This can sometimes really be really be "Pain in the Ass"!
```

But before we can come back to that, we have first to define some basic [Things]. Oh Man, perhaps I should not have started that, because after ten Minutes I already created a long List of very important new Things.

But before I could commit those, we first had to define other even more urgent [Things](), namely [Michi](19.md), the simple [Show Mouse](577.md) and my [Bunnie Page]().

And there was a small Problem to enable the [Broken Link]() page - not a big deal, I will do that together with Micha sometime later [1] .

But let's come back to the starting Point with the Footnotes. Obviously I had been a little bit too optimistic. Obviously on GitHub the modern fancy Features of the Markup Languate have not yet arrived. But this has time until Tomorrow.

So only one more Thing ...

Have a good Night!

## A nasty Egg

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.27-??:?? in Tübingen(TBD), Damn, I forgot to commit my [33.md](33.md) Baby. Normally this is no big Deal, but unfortunately the already committed [27.md](27.md) has a Reference to it:

```console
root:~ (devel)# head 27.md
# Echo Bug
Everytime when I execute the [mmls](33.md#mmls) command, a new file "echo" is created.
```

I am screwed when Someone checks out the Code now and sees the broken Link. So let's checkin the missing File quickly:

```console
root:~ (devel)# git add 33.md
root:~ (devel)# git commit -s -m "Add 33.md to fix the broken Link in 27.md in the previous commit"
[devel 5a30961] Add 33.md to fix the broken Link in 27.md in the previous commit
 1 file changed, 26 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 33.md
```

Puh, Nobody saw my Mistake and now we are save again:

```console
root:~ (devel)# git log --oneline | head -3
5a30961 Add 33.md to fix the broken Link in 27.md in the previous commit
c3c6df2 Add more Files to ignore
46aa317 Add Echo Bug
```

But wait, if some Grumpy gets to the crazy idea to check out "Echo Bug" Commit 46aa317, he can still find out my sloppiness. Oh Man, I really have laid myself a nasty egg:
```

Good Night und Gute N8!
