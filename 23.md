### Sorted-Things

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.02-14:45 in Tübingen, I already created a lot of Numbers in this Project and in order to not lose track of the Situation I created a [List](60008.md) where the Things have been [ordered](60010.md) more or less according their [Number](60000.md):

```console
$ head -n 4 Almost-Sorted-Things.txt 
30010003.md Pixel
30010002.md Full-HD
30010001.md Resolution
30010000.md Media-Formats
```

First I want to sort the List in the reverse Order:

```console
$ cat Almost-Sorted-Things.txt | sort -nr > Sorted-Things.txt
```

Next I would like to create a Markedown Document with clickable [Links](9000046.md) are clickable:

```
$ cat Sorted-Things.txt | (while read Number Name; do printf "%-14s %-20s [Link](%s)\n" $Number $Name $Number; done) > SortedThingsWithMarkDown.md
```

Looks almost good, but some Things have to be still fixed manually, for Example:

```
12000000.md    Expert               [Link](12000000.md)
11091971.md    Michael's            [Link](Calendar)
11091971.md                         [Link]()
11000000.md    History              [Link](11000000.md)
```

Afterwards I append the Result to the [README](README.md) File using the [Mv-Command](9000046):

```console
$ cat README.md SortedThingsWithMarkDown.md > tmp.md
$ mv tmp.md README.md
```

To make the Links clickable have added the Things using a Markdown-List:

---
- 1000000099.md  NinetyNine           [Link](1000000099.md)

- 30010003.md    Pixel                [Link](30010003.md)
- 30010002.md    Full-HD              [Link](30010002.md)
---

But somehow I don't like, how it looks like. For removing the Links again, I use the following Vim Command:

```
:%s/\s\+\[Link.*//g
```

Now it looks like the Following:

---
- 1000000099.md  NinetyNine

- 30010003.md    Pixel
- 30010002.md    Full-HD
- 30010001.md    Resolution
---

To replace the leading Bullets, I enter the Vim-Visual-Mode with the Control-v [Keyboard-Shortcut](9000048.md), then remove the leading Bullets and finally I mark the whole Section with "```" as a [Markdown-Code-Block](40003101.md):

```
1000000099.md  NinetyNine

30010003.md    Pixel
30010002.md    Full-HD
30010001.md    Resolution
```

Now it looks ok for the Time beeing.

### Big Things (again)

Now I come back to my old Question, how to store big Files in my Project. After I having rejected the idea using LFS for the time being, now another Concept came to my Mind.

What about storing the [Big-Data](9000049.md) seperate to the Not-So-Big-Data?

### Sample Image

I plan to test the new Idea with a Picture-for-Nicole:

<img src="55.jpg" alt="Picture-for-Nicole" style="width:600px; height: 450x;"/>

According my current Rules this is stored in Full-HD Resolution in my Clash-of-Clans [Git-Repository], where the Files have a current Size of about 4 Megabytes:

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans$ bash 9000038.bash | tail -n 2
README.md            3967 4121912
./2000002.md           34 4121879
```

The Byte-Size of our Picture in [JPG-Image-Format](30010004.md) is ...

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans$ ls -l 55.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  905873  2 Apr 19:08 55.jpg
```

If we divide the Size of 905.873 [Bytes](9000013.md) by 1024 we get around 900 [Kilo-Bytes](9000014.md).

Then I use the [Image-Editing](9000054.md) [Application](9000055.md) [Gimp](9000053.md) for Convertign the [Image](30000002.md) from compressed JPG-Image-Format into [RAW-Image-Format](30010005.md) and check its Byte-Size:

```console
~$ ls -l 55.raw 
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  29942784  2 Apr 21:08 55.raw
```

So now the same Picture in that [Format](60019.md) uses 29.942.784 Bytes or around 30 Mega-Bytes of my Disk-Drive.

Why is that?

### Compression

The Reason for the 29 Mega-Bytes Difference between JPG and RAW is [Compression](9000051.md). The JPG-Image-Format is highly compressed and still provides enough [Information](60007.md) that is required for [Rendering](9000052.md) the Picture in a way that a [Human](40000001.md) can understand it's [Meaning](60002.md).

The higher we make the [Compression-Level](9000057.md) of the JPG-Image is, the lower is the [File-Size](9000056.md):

```console
michael-holzheu@MacBook/55 $ ls -lS
total 72528
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  29942784  2 Apr 21:08 55.raw
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff   2382877  2 Apr 21:56 55-100.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff   2382877  2 Apr 21:56 55-80.jpg
-rw-r--r--@ 1 michael-holzheu  staff    905873  2 Apr 21:59 55-94.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    905873  2 Apr 21:56 55.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    243910  2 Apr 21:57 55-60.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    181193  2 Apr 21:57 55-40.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    118690  2 Apr 21:57 55-20.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff     50984  2 Apr 21:57 55-00.jpg
```

And the lower the Compression-Level, the lower is also the [Quality](60020.md):

<img src="50000055.jpg" alt="Picture-for-Nicole-with-JPG-Compression-Level-0" style="width:600px; height: 450x;"/>

But what does that mean?

### About Quality

Hmm, I somehow like the highly-compressed [Image](30000002.md), so probably we have to specify the Meaning of Quality a bit more.

For Example, we get into the [Territory](600036.md) of the [Fine-Arts](60000000.md), it is not so easy to measure the [Quantity](60021.md) of the Quality of a [Picture](60000001.md).

In the [Context](600034.md) of [Photography](50000000.md) it's a bit simpler, because a [Photo](50000001.md) should come close to [Reality](40000.md). So in this Respect the higher compressed Image has less Quality.

And the highest Quality regarding Reality should have the [Orignal](60022.md), no?

### The Orignal

In Photography the "best" [Image-Format](30010006.md) regarding Quality is probably the uncompressed RAW-Image-Format, but for our Example this is a bit more complicated.

The Reason is that current [Smart-Phones](20000005.md) normally store the Photos already in JPG-Image-Format and this is also the case for our [Picture-for-Nicole](55.jpg).

When I convert the compressed Image back to RAW-Image-Format, we probably even loose Qualtiy because during the [Conversion](600037.md) even more Image-Information will be lost.

If we assume that by [Definition](13000002.md) the Original is the Image with the best Quality, by [Logic](600038.md) we can come to the [Conclusion](600027.md) that our the JPG-Image is original.

But wait ...

According to my [Rules](5.md) I already resized the Image to Full-HD Format, therefore the File in this Repository is *not* the Original.

So let's copy the "Original" into our Directory:

```console
michael-holzheu@MacBook/55 $ ls -lS
total 75288
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  29942784  2 Apr 21:08 55.raw
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff   2382877  2 Apr 21:56 55-100.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff   2382877  2 Apr 21:56 55-80.jpg
-rw-r--r--@ 1 michael-holzheu  staff   1409592  2 Apr 19:04 original_60bf61ca-6207-4ed8-a563-17186415691b_20230401_141946.jpg
-rw-r--r--@ 1 michael-holzheu  staff    905873  2 Apr 21:59 55-94.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    905873  2 Apr 21:56 55.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    243910  2 Apr 21:57 55-60.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    181193  2 Apr 21:57 55-40.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    118690  2 Apr 21:57 55-20.jpg
-rw-r--r--@ 1 michael-holzheu  staff     50984  2 Apr 21:57 55-00.jpg
```

With its 1,4 Megabytes in Terms of File-Size it lies beetween the two Full-HD Images with 80% and 94% Compression.

This sounds good at first glance, but now let's use the [Exif-Tool](9000059.md) to check the [Image-Size](30010007.md):

```console
michael-holzheu@MacBook/55 $ exiftool original_60bf61ca-6207-4ed8-a563-17186415691b_20230401_141946.jpg | grep "Image Size"
Image Size                      : 3648x2736
```

This means that we have a [Resolution](30010001.md) of 3648 Pixels for the [Width](10000005.md) and 2736 for the [Height](10000006.md).

So according to [Adam-Ries](70000001.md) who is a famous [Personality](70000000.md) in the [Discipline](7000003.md) of [Mathematics](13000000.md), we have in total ...

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans$ echo "... $((3648 * 2736)) Pixels."
... 9980928 Pixels.
```

Taking into account the File-Size of 1409592 Bytes, this means that one Pixel requires ...

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ echo "... $((1409592 / 9980928)) Bytes."
... 0 Bytes.
```

Obviously [Arithmethic]() with more Quality is required here and we better use good-old [Floating-Point](13000004.md) to get some [Precision](10000007.md) into the [Calculation](13000003.md).

So let's switch from [Bash](34.md) to a [Computer-Language](9010000.md) with a little bit more [Functions](600039.md), namely ...

```
michael-holzheu@MacBook/55 $ perl -E "say 1409592 / 9980928"  
0.141228551092644
```

As a [Mathematician](80000002.md) this [Result](60033.md) reminds me to a [Famous-Number](13010000.md) but this is really pure [Coincidence](99.md).

Perhaps, perhaps not...

Wouldn't be [Life](404.md) without any [Secrets](https://www.holzheu.de/rumaenien-2018-teil-3#69mp3) not a litte [Bit](75.md) too boring?

Sleep well!

## Big Data Day

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-15:15 in Tübingen, After I finished Tennis Training, good Lunch and Shopping, now it's Time to find a good Solution for storing Big Data, like Music, Pictures, and Movies.

Up to now my favourite Solution was Git's [Large Files Support](15.md#Large-File-Support), but I already made some [unpleasant](666.md) Experiences with that [Software](9000006.md).

Although I already [configured](15.gitconfig) the Stuff, it is no longer working. For some [Reason](600030.md) the [Files](9000007.md) are still uploaded directly into the "normal" Git Repository.

The most [likely](600031.md) Reason is that I deleted and cloned the [Repository](9000010.md) many Times and therefore Parts of the [Configuration](9000011.md) have been lost.

### Experiments

In Order not to mess up my Clash-of-Clans I first create a new Repository to play with. But before doing that, I first want to store an [Image](30000002.md) in the "normal" Clash-of-Clans.

#### Commit Screenshot to Git

It is a [Screenshot](30000001.md) in [Full-HD](30010002.md) that has the Size of 170777 Bytes or equivalent to 167 Kilobytes:

```console
$ ls -l 88.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  170777  1 Apr 16:37 88.jpg
$ ls -lh 88.jpg 
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff   167K  1 Apr 16:37 88.jpg
```
##### Repository Data-Size

But before [committing]() the File, first check the old [Data-Size](9000016.md) of the Repository, which is 19120 [Bytes](9000013.md) or equivalent (more or less) to 9,3 [Mega-Bytes](9000015.md):

```console
$ du -s Clash-of-Clans 
19120	Clash-of-Clans
$ du -hs Clash-of-Clans
9,3M	Clash-of-Clans
```

Oehm...

I noticed that is wrong with the above Values. One 9,3 

bytes are around 9,3 * 1.000 * 1.000 = 9.3000.000 Byte. But the "du -s" Command shows me only 9,3 Magabyte.

So what's the Problem?

As every [Expert](12000000.md) in [Informatics](9000000.md) knows, a [Disk-Drive](20000002.md) stores [Data](60001.md) in [Blocks](9000018.md) and the Usage of the [Device](20000000.md) is therefore also shown in that [Unit](10000003.md).

So to calculate the Usage in Bytes we first have to find out the [Block-Size](9000017.md):

```
$ diskutil info / | grep "Block Size"
   Device Block Size:         4096 Bytes
   Allocation Block Size:     4096 Bytes

$ $ stat -f %k .
4096
```

This means that one Block on [My-Mac-Book](2000002.md) has 4096 Bytes and therefore the Disk-Drive-Usage can be calculated with ...

```
$ echo "$((4096 * 19120))"
78315520
```

For [Verification]() we calculate the Size in Mega-Bytes with ...

```
$ echo "$((1000 * 1000))"
1000000

$ echo "$((78315520 / 1000000))"
78
```

Oehm ...

As we saw at the beginning the "du -sh" Command told us that the "Clash of Clans" [Directory](9000019.md) uses 9,3 Mega-Bytes of Disk [Storage](9000020.md). The Question is, how does that match to the 78 Mega-Bytes, we calculated by the Blocksize and the "du -s" Command?

Let's find first out the [Sum](3000001.md) of the [Byte-Sizes](9000021.md) of all [Files](9000007.md) in the Directory:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ ls

```

That's a lot of files ...

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ ls | wc -w
     165
```

Let's write a "short" [Script](9000023.md) that forms a [Sum](13000001.md) over all the File-Sizes:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ ls -l | tail -n +2 | (while read -r Line; do FileSize=$(echo $Line | awk '{print $5}'); FileName=$(echo $Line | awk '{print $9}'); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done)
0.md                  442   442
1.md                  228   670
100.md                130   800
10000.jpg           43265 44065
...
9000019.md             32 3194690
9000020.md             26 3194716
904.md                120 3194836
README.md             256 3195092
```

I realize that the Sum over all File-Sizes is 3195092 Bytes, or written different as 3.195.092 Bytes, respective around 3.195 Kilo-Bytes or 3 Mega-Bytes.

We saw above that the [Du-Command](9000028.md) with the [Command-Options](9000029.md) "-hs" tells me that the [Disk-Usage](9000027.md) is 9,3 Mega-Bytes, so where are the missing 6 Mega-Bytes?

Of course every good [Computer](20000003.md) Expert knows that most [Operating-Systems](9000030.md) provide [File-Systems](9000025.md), that provide [Hidden-Files](9000026.md).

Traditionally under [Unix](9000031.md) hidden Files begin with a Dot and with the so-called [Find-Command](9000032.md) we can show behind the Scenes and already the first Line of [Output](60017.md) shows the hidden [Pointer](9000033.md) "." to the current [Work-Directory](9000034.md).

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ find .
.
./50003.md
./100.md
```

Looking further down, we see the first "real" Hidden-File, namely ...

```
./20.md
./30.md
./.gitignore
```

BTW, the Data in the [Git-Ignore-File](58.md#git-ignore-file) defines all Files that should be ingored by the Git-Command.

But before we come back on that, let's rewrite our original Skript a bit and use the [Grep-Command](9000036.md), the [Stat-Command](9000037.md) plus some [Regular-Expressions](9000035.md) for the Calculation of the Disk-Usage:

```
$ find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done)
./50003.md            139   139
./9000025.md           36   175

...

./2.md                333 3198498
./2000002.md           34 3198532
```

Hmm, now we get 3198510 Bytes and the old Script calculated 3195092 Bytes, if I remember correctly, so thats ...

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$  echo "$((3195092 - 3198532)) Bytes less."
-3440 Bytes less.
```

Of course every real [Nerd](12000001.md) who thinks he's something in the Computing Area, knows of course that we created a lot of Files since we ran the old Script the last Time.

Before looking into that one, we copy the new [Code](9000039.md) into a separate File [Du-Script](9000038.bash) and check its [Content](600021.md) with the [Cat-Command](9000040.md):

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ cat 9000038.bash
# Du-Script

find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done)
```

As first [Test-Case](9000042.md) of the Script I run it with [Bash-](34.md) and the [Tail-Command](9000041.md):

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ bash 9000038.bash | tail -n 2
./2.md                333 3198802
./2000002.md           34 3198836
```

Now let me run the Code again as [One-Liner](700012.md) and compare the Output:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done) | tail -n 2
./2.md                333 3198802
./2000002.md           34 3198836
```

Now I add the first One-Liner to my Du-Script and add the "tail -n 1" command to both Lines:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ cat 9000038.bash
# Du-Script

# First Script
ls -l | tail -n +2 | (while read -r Line; do FileSize=$(echo $Line | awk '{print $5}'); FileName=$(echo $Line | awk '{print $9}'); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done) | tail -n 1

# Second Script
find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done) | tail -n 1
```

So now when running the Script in [Theory](7000001.md) I would expect to see two Lines showing the same Result, so let's try it ...

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ bash 9000038.bash 
README.md             256 3201483
./2000002.md           34 3199246
```

To find out the [Reason](600030.md) for the [Problem](600029.md) some some [Debugging](9000044.md) is required. My first [Hypothis]() is that the second Script for why ever finds less Files that the first one.

And indeed, after I checked the List of [File-Types](9000045.md) and realized that three of them are missing, I add them to the second Script:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ git diff
diff --git a/9000038.bash b/9000038.bash
index 748352c..d175d9c 100644
--- a/9000038.bash
+++ b/9000038.bash
@@ -4,4 +4,4 @@

 # Second Script
-find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done) | tail -n 1
+find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc|dockerfile|vimrc|gitconfig)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done) | tail -n 1
```

Now I am confident that both Scripts will show the same Result now:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ bash 9000038.bash
README.md             256 3201540
./2000002.md           34 3201510
```

Oh Boy, still not finished, let's look at our Files again:

Finally I found the [Lazy-Egg](404.md) and renamed it:

```
$ git mv 700001 700001.md
$ git commit -m "Rename Document"
$ git push
```

Nice, but what has all this to do with "Clash of Clans"?

Will see ...

## Problems Day

### DB-Navigator Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-01:20, We looked up for a Train back to Tübigen and the DB-App shows me a possible Connection. Nice, so I can save the Money for the Taxi. After I waiting 20 Minutes on the Subway-Platform, I read the Timetable which then tells me that there are no more trains at this time.

So looks like this is a Problem with the [DB-Navigator](8009999.md).

### Samsung Pen Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-00:36, I show Nicole my Project and she suggests to use the Pen of my [Samsung-Galaxy-S22-Ultra](20000001.md) and test Handwriting. After 10 Minutes fighting with Problems we stopped the [Experiment](10010000.md).

### Electricity Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-22:18 on my Way to Nicole, This time I did not forget my Charging-Device for the MacBook and fortunately the [German-Federal-Raiload](8009999.md) provides [Electricity](10000001.md), Problem solved!

### Heil-und-Kostenplan Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-13:OO in Tübingen, I read an E-Mail from the [Singing-Dentist](404.md), where he points out that I have forgotten to bring the [Heil-und-Kostenplan](8000999.md#Heil-und-Kostenplan) as I promised.
 
In fact I was Yesterday Evening at the Dental-Practice. Before putting the Document into the Post-Box, I skimmed it a very last time. Then I noticed a yellow Label:

```
* Achtung
Sehr geehrter Patient!
Bitte diesen Heil- und Kostenplan
1. zusammen mit dem Bunusheft bei Ihrer Krankenkasse einreichen
2. nach Zuschussfestsetzung durch die Kasse den Antrag bitte umgehend an die Praxis zurück
```

Unfortunately I only read up to Line Number 4, and then concluded that I have taken the wrong Document. So unfortunatley the Way was for Nothing.

Back home I search for the "right" Document which I - by logical [Conclusion](600027.md) - cannot find.

I felt rememinded to my recently [lost Work](#about-trust). So I developted the [Hypothesis](600028.md) that I might have already delivered the Document. But then I checked my [Calendar](11091971.md) found out the [Truth](600021.md):

For the first Appointment I brought the wrong Document and I promised to deliver the right one for the next (second) Session. If my [Memory](600032.md) does not deceive me, I see almost 100% [Probablity](600031.md) that something must have gone wrong.

Therefore I now also read the 5th [Line](50010.md) and detected the [Reason](600030.md) for my [Problem](600029.md).

After that [Realization](600033.md) I grabbed the Heil- und Kostenplan, walked agein to the Dentist and put the Document into his Post-Box.

Problem solved!

## More Concepts Day

### Finished Work

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-23:25 still on my Way to Nicole, I finished the Work for Today, CU Tomorrow!

### About Apple Macbook Pro 14'' M1

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-23:17 still on my Way to Nicole, Not a good Time for the Project. Today, my MacBook seems to empty his Battery faster than expected ... 

### About Trust (again)

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-22:47 still on my Way to Nicole, Believe it or not my first Information Container Concepts have disappeared ...

### Information Containers

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-22:34 finally on my Way to Nicole, I start to add Concepts about Information Containers.

### About Trust

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-22:19 on my Way to Nicole, Believe it or not, but our Story about "Micha ... (again)" is lost somewhere in all this crazy mess.

### Add Theory

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-20:03 in Tübingen(TBD), Before starting the real work, I first want to summarize the [Theory](700001.md) into a List.

### Add History

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-13:27 in Tübingen(TBD), I decided to combine my first Days into this [Document](700001.md) for describing the [History](11000000.md) of this Project.

## First Concepts Day

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.29-17-25, I am on my Way to Nicole [1] and after the [Cleanup Work](100.md) Yesterday, now I would like to use the [Time](10000002.md) for adding some new [Concepts](600011.md).

## Big "Cleanup" Day

Blog-Chain-Time [2023.03.28-22:35](1100001.md) in [Tübingen](2000001.md), After Micha did the technical Work Yesterday, today our Creative Chief Officer [Michi](19.md) joined our Party to bring a bit more Pepper into the Souce.

But first I really want to beatify our [Work](99.md) a little bit.

So let's first check what we have written in the Document [0] with the meaningful Number [99](1000000099.md), where obviously Somebody forgot to add a [Footnote](50003.md) for this famous saying:

```
But Caution is the Mother of the Porcelain Box, so let's make some Experiments first.
```

Our current Favourite [Markdown Footnotes](50001.md) have the Drawback that the [Numbers]() have to be specified manually, and to put it strait:

```
This can sometimes really be really be "Pain in the Ass"!
```

But before we can come back to that, we have first to define some basic [Things]. Oh Man, perhaps I should not have started that, because after ten Minutes I already created a long List of very important new Things.

But before I could commit those, we first had to define other even more urgent [Things](), namely [Michi](19.md), the simple [Show Mouse](577.md) and my [Bunnie Page]().

And there was a small Problem to enable the [Broken Link]() page - not a big deal, I will do that together with Micha sometime later [1] .

But let's come back to the starting Point with the Footnotes. Obviously I had been a little bit too optimistic. Obviously on GitHub the modern fancy Features of the Markup Languate have not yet arrived. But this has time until Tomorrow.

So only one more Thing ...

Have a good Night!

### Footnotes

- [0] [Document](50000.md) 
- [1] [ToDos](9.md#fix-404-page) 

## A nasty Egg

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.27-??:?? in Tübingen(TBD), Damn, I forgot to commit my [33.md](33.md) Baby. Normally this is no big Deal, but unfortunately the already committed [27.md](27.md) has a Reference to it:

```console
root:~ (devel)# head 27.md
# Echo Bug
Everytime when I execute the [mmls](33.md#mmls) command, a new file "echo" is created.
```

I am screwed when Someone checks out the Code now and sees the broken Link. So let's checkin the missing File quickly:

```console
root:~ (devel)# git add 33.md
root:~ (devel)# git commit -s -m "Add 33.md to fix the broken Link in 27.md in the previous commit"
[devel 5a30961] Add 33.md to fix the broken Link in 27.md in the previous commit
 1 file changed, 26 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 33.md
```

Puh, Nobody saw my Mistake and now we are save again:

```console
root:~ (devel)# git log --oneline | head -3
5a30961 Add 33.md to fix the broken Link in 27.md in the previous commit
c3c6df2 Add more Files to ignore
46aa317 Add Echo Bug
```

But wait, if some Grumpy gets to the crazy idea to check out "Echo Bug" Commit 46aa317, he can still find out my sloppiness. Oh Man, I really have laid myself a nasty egg:
```

Good Night und Gute N8!
