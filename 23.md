## Problems Day

### DB-Navigator Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-01:20, We looked up for a Train back to Tübigen and the DB-App shows me a possible Connection. Nice, so I can save the Money for the Taxi. After I waiting 20 Minutes on the Subway-Platform, I read the Timetable which then tells me that there are no more trains at this time.

So looks like this is a Problem with the [DB-Navigator](8009999.md).

### Samsung Pen Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-00:36, I show Nicole my Project and she suggests to use the Pen of my [Samsung-Galaxy-S22-Ultra](20000001.md) and test Handwriting. After 10 Minutes fighting with Problems we stopped the [Experiment](10010000.md).

### Electricity Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-22:18 on my Way to Nicole, This time I did not forget my Charging-Device for the MacBook and fortunately the [German-Federal-Raiload](8009999.md) provides [Electricity](10000001.md), Problem solved!

### Heil-und-Kostenplan Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-13:OO in Tübingen, I read an E-Mail from the [Singing-Dentist](404.md), where he points out that I have forgotten to bring the [Heil-und-Kostenplan](8000999.md#Heil-und-Kostenplan) as I promised.
 
In fact I was Yesterday Evening at the Dental-Practice. Before putting the Document into the Post-Box, I skimmed it a very last time. Then I noticed a yellow Label:

```
* Achtung
Sehr geehrter Patient!
Bitte diesen Heil- und Kostenplan
1. zusammen mit dem Bunusheft bei Ihrer Krankenkasse einreichen
2. nach Zuschussfestsetzung durch die Kasse den Antrag bitte umgehend an die Praxis zurück
```

Unfortunately I only read up to Line Number 4, and then concluded that I have taken the wrong Document. So unfortunatley the Way was for Nothing.

Back home I search for the "right" Document which I - by logical [Conclusion](600027.md) - cannot find.

I felt rememinded to my recently [lost Work](#about-trust). So I developted the [Hypothesis](600028.md) that I might have already delivered the Document. But then I checked my [Calendar](11091971.md) found out the [Truth](600021.md):

For the first Appointment I brought the wrong Document and I promised to deliver the right one for the next (second) Session. If my [Memory](600032.md) does not deceive me, I see almost 100% [Probablity](600031.md) that something must have gone wrong.

Therefore I now also read the 5th [Line](50010.md) and detected the [Reason](600030.md) for my [Problem](600029.md).

After that [Realization](600033.md) I grabbed the Heil- und Kostenplan, walked agein to the Dentist and put the Document into his Post-Box.

Problem solved!

## More Concepts Day

### Finished Work

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-23:25 still on my Way to Nicole, I finished the Work for Today, CU Tomorrow!

### About Apple Macbook Pro 14'' M1

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-23:17 still on my Way to Nicole, Not a good Time for the Project. Today, my MacBook seems to empty his Battery faster than expected ... 

### About Trust (again)

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-22:47 still on my Way to Nicole, Believe it or not my first Information Container Concepts have disappeared ...

### Information Containers

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-22:34 finally on my Way to Nicole, I start to add Concepts about Information Containers.

### About Trust

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-22:19 on my Way to Nicole, Believe it or not, but our Story about "Micha ... (again)" is lost somewhere in all this crazy mess.

### Add Theory

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-20:03 in Tübingen(TBD), Before starting the real work, I first want to summarize the [Theory](700001.md) into a List.

### Add History

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-13:27 in Tübingen(TBD), I decided to combine my first Days into this [Document](700001.md) for describing the [History](11000000.md) of this Project.

## First Concepts Day

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.29-17-25, I am on my Way to Nicole [1] and after the [Cleanup Work](100.md) Yesterday, now I would like to use the [Time](10000002.md) for adding some new [Concepts](600011.md).

## Big "Cleanup" Day

Blog-Chain-Time [2023.03.28-22:35](1100001.md) in [Tübingen](2000001.md), After Micha did the technical Work Yesterday, today our Creative Chief Officer [Michi](19.md) joined our Party to bring a bit more Pepper into the Souce.

But first I really want to beatify our [Work](99.md) a little bit.

So let's first check what we have written in the Document [0] with the meaningful Number [99](1000000099.md), where obviously Somebody forgot to add a [Footnote](50003.md) for this famous saying:

```
But Caution is the Mother of the Porcelain Box, so let's make some Experiments first.
```

Our current Favourite [Markdown Footnotes](50001.md) have the Drawback that the [Numbers]() have to be specified manually, and to put it strait:

```
This can sometimes really be really be "Pain in the Ass"!
```

But before we can come back to that, we have first to define some basic [Things]. Oh Man, perhaps I should not have started that, because after ten Minutes I already created a long List of very important new Things.

But before I could commit those, we first had to define other even more urgent [Things](), namely [Michi](19.md), the simple [Show Mouse](577.md) and my [Bunnie Page]().

And there was a small Problem to enable the [Broken Link]() page - not a big deal, I will do that together with Micha sometime later [1] .

But let's come back to the starting Point with the Footnotes. Obviously I had been a little bit too optimistic. Obviously on GitHub the modern fancy Features of the Markup Languate have not yet arrived. But this has time until Tomorrow.

So only one more Thing ...

Have a good Night!

## A nasty Egg

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.27-??:?? in Tübingen(TBD), Damn, I forgot to commit my [33.md](33.md) Baby. Normally this is no big Deal, but unfortunately the already committed [27.md](27.md) has a Reference to it:

```console
root:~ (devel)# head 27.md
# Echo Bug
Everytime when I execute the [mmls](33.md#mmls) command, a new file "echo" is created.
```

I am screwed when Someone checks out the Code now and sees the broken Link. So let's checkin the missing File quickly:

```console
root:~ (devel)# git add 33.md
root:~ (devel)# git commit -s -m "Add 33.md to fix the broken Link in 27.md in the previous commit"
[devel 5a30961] Add 33.md to fix the broken Link in 27.md in the previous commit
 1 file changed, 26 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 33.md
```

Puh, Nobody saw my Mistake and now we are save again:

```console
root:~ (devel)# git log --oneline | head -3
5a30961 Add 33.md to fix the broken Link in 27.md in the previous commit
c3c6df2 Add more Files to ignore
46aa317 Add Echo Bug
```

But wait, if some Grumpy gets to the crazy idea to check out "Echo Bug" Commit 46aa317, he can still find out my sloppiness. Oh Man, I really have laid myself a nasty egg:
```

Good Night und Gute N8!
