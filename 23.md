###### Topics: Zero-Wave-Theory, Dings-Patent

Because I like the Idea with the [Zero-Wave-Device](20000021.md), I now file a Draft for my very first [Dings-Patent](300000030.md), that is simply called:

- [The-Zero-Wave-Device-Patent](300050001.md)

But how can I prove that this was really my Idea?

The Solution is a [Block-Chain](300000000.md): Because up to now I have not yet implemented my own Version, for the Time being I (miss-)use the [Git-System](9000197.md), where [Check-Sums](13000019.md) are used to secure the different [Git-Commits](9000070.md).

My "Git-Block-Chain" can be downloaded by Everybody using with the following [Git-Clone-Command](9000086.md) to checkout the Zero-Repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:All-Dings/0.git
```

This creates a Directory "0", hat contains the complete History for this Repository.

After the Checkout has been done, it is possible to regulary get the latest Updates by first changing into the "0"-Directory ...

```bash
$ cd 0
```

... and then issuing the [Git-Pull-Command](9000094.md):

```bash
$ git pull
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 3 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
From github.com:All-Dings/777
   2e70928..fafe410  Master     -> origin/Master
Updating 2e70928..fafe410
 test | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 test
```

With the [Git-Log-Command](9000141.md), One can see the History of the different [Git-Commits](9000070.md):

```bash
commit 5c973ec27e7220239eb55efc50c153f6b0f140b0
Author: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
Date:   Sat Oct 14 20:15:13 2023 +0200

    Add Zero-Wave-Device-Patent
```

In case I would change Entries in the History, this Command will fail:

```bash
$ git pull
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
```

So for now this is a good-enough [Solution](600024.md) for the [Proof](600022.md), that I really did "Something" at a given [Time](610005.md).

Since 2023.04.08 with [My-IBM-Room-Mate-Friend](1971091166.md) I already have at least one Person, who regularily verfies the Zero-Repository - up to now without any Complaints.

But of course Everybody else is also invited to become a [Witness](670034.md) of [The-Truth](600140.md) for the [Dings-Project](300000006.md).

###### Topics: Zero-Wave-Theory, Invention

In Front of the Home-Door I meet our [Head-Of-House](1971091164.md) and seize the Opportunitiy to show her my [latest](#12009) Sinus-[Plot](700021.md). She agrees that my [Zero-Wave-Theory](301000002.md) sounds reasonable.

After my [Complaint](600167.md), that up to now even the best [Experts](12000000.md) could not provide a good [Explanation](60014.md) for this rather simple [Question](600107.md), she suggests to speak with [Crocodile-Dundee](1971091165.md), who even owns a [Diploma](640020.md) in [Physics](10000000.md).

Coincidentally some Minutes later I meet him on a Smoking-Round and we come up with two possible [Truths](600021.md) for the missing [Energy](10000040.md), namely [Elimination](600165.md) or [Transformation](600164.md).

In Order to save our beloved [Engergy-Conservatoin-Law](10000017.md), I already defined the Former as Transformation into [Zero-Engery](10000071.md), which is carried by [Zero-Things](10000061.md). For the Latter my Friend suggests to use the standard [Physics-Excuse](10000069.md), namely [Trasformation](600164.md) into [Heat](10000070.md).

Still not 100% sure about [Light-Waves](10000012.md) [[2]](#12052), but at least for [Sound-Waves](40200001.md), we now have two reasonable [Theories](7000001.md):

1. Transformation into [Heat-Energy](10000070.md)
2. Transformation into [Zero-Energy](10000071.md)

Depending on [The-Truth](600140.md), we now can build a [Device](20000000.md) either for [Heating](10000072.md) or [Cooling](10000073.md), where especially the second Option sounds very promising for fighting our [Global-Warming](400000002.md).

But for this Case I give to Consideration, that the [Zero-Particles](10000061.md) might be channeled somehow into a [Parallel-Universe](10000075.md), where they are transformed again into Heat-Energy and then we would unintentionally produce [Global-Warming](400000002.md) for our [Alien-Friends](40000031.md), Damn!

Fortunately my [Neighbour-Friend](1971091165.md) calms me down a bit with the [Argument](600151.md), that the Energy could also be sent to an [Inanimate-Universe](10000077.md) without [Violation](60075.md) of any [Ethic-Rules](14400001.md).

Either cool or not, here the first Concept-Drawing for the Function of my new [Invention](60124.md):

###### Topics: Zero-Wave-Theory

After a good Meal at the [Morra-Imbiss](2010031.md) and a theological Conversation with [Heisam](150000006.md), on my Way back Home I meet again [My-Python-Neighbour](1971091159.md), who is by the Way a retired [Physics-Teacher](630004.md).

He speaks to me about the Problem with the Zero-Waves and says that with the [Superposition](10000065.md) an [Interferrence](10000064.md) arises, where the (missing) Engery goes and therefore the [Energy-Conservation-Law](10000017.md) is not violated.

I still have some Doubts and try to explain my View of Things with a "Cigarette-Drawing" on the [Walk-Way](1100000018.md). I also argue, that there are already [Applications](600163.md) of my [Zero-Wave-Theory](301000002.md), like [Anti-Sound](10000066.md) for loud [Trucks](200500005.md) or [Noise-Cancellation](10000067.md) in [Head-Sets](20000020.md).

For an [Explanation](60014.md) of this [Technology](16000001.md), here a more accurate Version of my [Side-Walk](1100000018.md)-Plot:

###### Topics: Pythagorean-Comma

After the last [Choir-Rehearsal](90001002.md) I had a longer Discussion with my [Female-Choir-Friend](1971091160.md) about the old [[1]](#12051) Story of the [Pythagorean-Comma](90000013.md). As reported, the Problem seems to be, that the [Pure-Fiths](90000039.md) do not fit 100% to the [Pure-Octaves](90000028.md).

Today I get an E-Mail, where is written, that she calculated the [Frequence-Ratio](10000062.md) of the 15 Fiths in 7 Octaves using a Frequency-[Table](700051.md):

> Aus einer Tabelle habe ich 1,498... berechnet

Sounds reasonable, but better double-check: My Music-[Tiger](40000010.md) wants to squeeze 12 Fiths into 7 [Pure-Ocataves](90000038.md) and as all good [Mathematicians](80000002.md) already know, the Ratio for the Fiths must be $\sqrt[12]{2^7}$.

I enter the [Formula](13000025.md) into [My-Old-Pocket-Calculator](1971091108.md) and interestingly get a slightly different [Result](60033.md), than my female Choir-Colleague:

![First Calculation](400000106.jpg)

Strange, I don't know the Woman like that, because until now she seemed quite reliable to me. Therefore I write back a short Reply to my dear Music-[Sister](40000010.md):

> Komisch, ich bin auf 1,499 gekommen, vielleicht ein Rundungs-Fehler?

Then I interrupted my daily Work on the Dings-Project to figure out the Problem. So my Math-[Champion](40000010.md) wants to put 12 Fiths _F_ into 7 Ocataves _O_, which can be expressed by the following [Equation](13000026.md):

$$ F^12 = O^7 $$

Since my Music-[Star](40000010.md) wants to keep the Octaves with the Ratio 2:1, we substitue $O$ with $\frac{2}{1} = 2$:

$$ F^12 = 2^7 $$

As we already know, the [Exponentiation](13000022.md) can be expanded:

$$ F^12 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 $$

The [Associative-Property](13000035.md) of the [Multiplication](13000021.md) allows us, to use [Brackets](700057.md) for making it a bit easier:

$$ F^12 = (2*2) * (2*2) * (2*2) * 2 $$

Then we calculate the Sub-[Terms](13000032.md):

$$ F^12 = 4 * 4 * 4 * 2 $$

Let's add one last Bracket:

$$ F^12 = (4 * 4) * 4 * 2 $$

Now we get the Following:

$$ F^12 = 16 * 4 * 2 $$

High Numbers are [Pain-in-the-Ass](404.md) for the [Brain](40000026.md), so use the a Property of our [Positional-Notation](13000036.md) to make our Life simpler:

$$ F^12 = (10 + 6) * 4 * 2 $$

Then we use the nice [Distributive-Feature](13000037.md) of our [Real-Numbers](13000039.md), but [Watch out Boy](300003.md) - don't forget the Brackets:

$$ F^12 = (10*4 + 6*4) * 2 $$

The Rest we do with [Mental-Arithmetic](40000038.md):

$$ F^12 = (40 + 24) * 2 $$

We all know that $4 + 2 = 6$ and $0 + 4 = 4$, therefore:

$$ F^12 = 64 * 2 $$

We all know that $60 * 2 = 120$ and $4 * 2 = 8$, therefore:

$$ F^12 = 128 $$

The very last Step is for advanced Mathematicians:

$$ F = 128^{\frac{1}{12}} = \sqrt[12]{128} $$

The Rest is "Just Doing", therefore we use a [Pocket-Caculater](20000019.md) for that, but a least this Time I double-check with the virtual Calculator from [My-Mac-Book](2000002.md):

![Second Calculation](400000108.jpg)

Strange, this means 2:1 against the Table of my Music-[Fairy](40000010.md):

![Win for the Man/Machine?](400000109.jpg)

Oh Boy, don't be stupid! We all know [Mens-Rule-Nr-1](200100004.md), so the Mistake must be on our Side. And because this is a really hard Nut, this Time I definitely need really competent Help. So Tomorrow let's ask my Mens-Colleague [Bert](1971091153.md), because Today it has already become quite late:

![Don't forget: Ask Bert!](400000110.jpg)

###### Topics: Pythagorean-Comma

The next Day I get up very early for Traing with [My-Tennis-Teacher](1971991161.md). Afterwards I meet three [Women](40000010.md), who look like other [Versions](600149.md) to three of my known Choir-Colleagues, crazy.

At the [Delhi-Palace](18071962.md) my dear [Asha](1971091162.md) gives me the [Advice](600150.md) to put [Focus](60143.md) in my Project on [The-Bad-Stuff](60121.md) because the [Good-Stuff](60120.md) is done by Others. I don't know if I understood her correctly, because she sometimes misses the right [German](600004.md) Words.

After my Indian-[Charu](40000010.md) expresses her [Concern](10000063.md), that I am doing too many Projects in parallel, I try to reassure her with the [Argument](600151.md) that this Work will support my real [Goal](60058.md) and in the End Everything will go very quickly.

We also briefly talk about Men in [India](140000064.md), who I have already heard Sometimes do not treat their Women very well, Asha's means, especially the Native Ones.

This reminds me to a funny Conversation about replacing Men with Machines, that I had recently with a cute Blonde off [our](2010013.md) Choir-Rehersal:

![Better use a Machine?](400000112.jpg)

But let's focus on our Main-Topic: Because of [Rule-1](200100004.md) it is clear, that my ϕοκκινγ (Calculating)-Machines have Problems, therefore now I want to do really *all* manually.

While eating [My-Favourite-Indian-Meal](404.md) I make a few Calculations in my Head and come to the Conclusion that I am able to reduce our Calculation-Problem to $\sqrt{2}$, which after all can be measured with [Geometry](13006000.md) and is related to the famous [Pythagorean-Theorem](12000053.md), the every diligent [Lerner](60087.md) knows by Heart:

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

But before I come back on that, I first buy some Equipment in a [Stationery-Shop](200020005.md), that I then transport with my Bicycle to the Bus-Station:

![Tools for School](400000113.jpg)

At the Bus-Station I have short Discussion with a young Woman about [Politics](141000000.md) and we came up with the Idea to use the [Schimpf-Eck](2010030.md) as a [Speakers-Corner](141000007.md). But before we can do that, we should definitely ask [Mr-Palmer](404.md) for more Traffic-Mitigation.

Back at Home I finally manage it to read the last E-Mail from my Friend from Bottom-Up, were she first makes a [Confession](600158.md):

> Hatte meine Tabelle falsch gelesen.

Of course this must be a [White-Lie](600161.md) to make me feel better - such a nice [Cupcake](40000010.md). We all know that [Rule-1](200100004.md) is [Truth-by-Definition](600152.md), which now reminds me to a Discussion about [1:N-Relations](60093.md), I had this Afternoon mit [my](88.md) dear Fellow-Occupant.

Then I read further and get to know, that [My-Female-Choir-Friend](1971091160.md) now also did a [Verification](600128.md) with her [Personal-Computer](404.md):

> Nun habe ich in Excel nachgerechnet: F = (2^7)^(1/12) = 1,498307076877

Well, of course we know that there are old Versions of [Excel](2000221.md) that produced wrong Results and oh Boy, we all remember the really nasty [Pentium-FDIV-Bug](72000002.md) from 1994, but what is the [Likelihood](600031.md), that my Friend is really affected by those Threats?

And BTW, since serveral Years I get more and more the Impression that our [Development](404.md) is going into the wrong Direction, namely from [The-Better](60136.md) to [The-Worse](60153.md). A good Example is this 20-Year old and still comfortable [Running-Shoe](404.md), as seen Today in the early Evening:

![Old but still Good!](400000115.jpg)

But [Safety-First](404.md), so let's nevertheless do my planned [Measurement](10000022.md). Although my new Baby and I have been really careful, the Operation still gets a bit messy - obviously we need more physical [Training](600100.md):

![Sloddy Work](400000114.jpg)

But probably good enough, so now we can do Everything with Manual-Operation and without the Help of such silly Machines - so back to our last Equation:

$$ F = 128^{\frac{1}{12}} $$

So first let's apply on both Sides the Exponentiation an [Exponent](13000043.md) of Two:

$$ F^2 = {128^{\frac{1}{12}}}^2 $$

An [Exponentiation-Function](13000022.md) is defined by its [Base](13000040.md) and the [Parameter](13000041.md) of the [Function](13000011.md) is called the [Exponent](13000043.md) and as all good Mathematicians already know, our Exponentiation with Exponent 2 can be replaced by a [Multiplication](13000021.md) with 2 in the Exponent:

$$ F^2 = 128^{\frac{1}{12} * 2} = 128^{\frac{1 * 2}{12}} = 128^{\frac{2}{12}} $$

Now we can simplify the [Fraction](13000007.md) in the [Exponent](13000043.md) by a [Division](12000044.md) by the [Greatest-Common-Divisor](12000050.md):

$$ F^2 = 128^{\frac{2}{12}} = 128^{\frac{\frac{2}{2}}{\frac{12}{2}}} = 128^{\frac{1}{6}} $$

Ok cool, now we eliminate the Exponent on the left Side by [Exponentiation](13000022.md) with $\frac{1}{2}$:

$$ F^{2*\frac{1}{2}} = 128^{\frac{1}{6} * \frac{1}{2}} $$

Oehm, this somehow looks familiar, but thank Good, as every good [Informatic-Student](9999998.md) already knows by Heart, we fortunately can rewrite the Binary-Number 128 as Follows:

$$ F = 128^\frac{1}{12} = (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2)^\frac{1}{12} = {2^7}^\frac{1}{12} $$

With the already successfully applied Mechanism, we further simplify that:

$$ F = ({2^7})^\frac{1}{12} = 2^{7*\frac{1}{12}} = 2^{\frac{7}{12}} $$

What the Φοκκ, obviously I made a Mistake in the Indian-Restaurant, because I cannot reduce this Term to $\sqrt{2}$, sorry my Bad. But no Problem, because all good Mathematicians know, we can use [Newton's–Method](12000054.md) for getting an [Approximation](600156.md) for the [Root-Function](13000023.md).

Ohm, how is the simple Formuala expressed in LaTeX? As already mentioned, my Skills are a bit rusty here and there, but thanks God I have [My-Good-Old-Latex-Book](9300010.md):

![Good-Old Book](400000116.jpg)

Here a [Good-Man](404.md) with [Patience](41000007.md) is able find the [TeX-Symbols](60094.md), that are required for the Translation to the beautiful [Mathematics-Symbols](13000033.md):

$$ x_{n + 1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} $$

Because it is already late, I ask [Chat-Gpt](9000150.md) to do the Work for me, but without applying the "Potenz-Regel":

```python
def zwölfte_wurzel_berechnen(zahl, genauigkeit=1e-6, max_iterationen=100):
    # Initialisiere den Schätzwert mit der Hälfte der Zahl
    schätzwert = zahl / 2.0

    for i in range(max_iterationen):
        # Verwende die Newton-Raphson-Formel, um den nächsten Schätzwert zu berechnen
        nächster_schätzwert = (11 * schätzwert**12 + zahl) / (12 * schätzwert**11)

        # Überprüfe, ob die gewünschte Genauigkeit erreicht wurde
        if abs(nächster_schätzwert - schätzwert) < genauigkeit:
            return nächster_schätzwert

        schätzwert = nächster_schätzwert

    # Falls die gewünschte Genauigkeit nicht erreicht wurde, gebe den letzten Schätzwert aus
    return schätzwert

# Eingabe der Zahl, deren 12. Wurzel berechnet werden soll
zahl = float(input("Bitte geben Sie eine Zahl ein: "))

# Berechnung der 12. Wurzel
ergebnis = zwölfte_wurzel_berechnen(zahl)

# Ausgabe des Ergebnisses
print(f"Die 12. Wurzel von {zahl} ist etwa {ergebnis}")

```

Then I run the Program and thank God, finally the [AI](250000038.md) and the [Interpreter](9010008.md) of [Python](9010003.md) come (at least almost ...) to the same Result as my [My-Female-Choir-Friend](1971091160.md):

###### Topics: Zero-Wave-Theory

I meet my [Python-Neighbour](1971091159.md) again, who comes from [India](140000064.md) and studied [Theoretical-Physics](10000060.md). I ask him about the [Paradox](60150.md), that I recently discussed [[0]](#12050) with [My-Professor-Friend](1971091158.md).

Two identical [Lasers](20000018.md) with 180 Degree Phase-Shift in [Theory](7000001.md) eliminate each other and the resulting [Energy](10000040.md) is Zero. My Neighbour agrees, after he briefly calculated the Following in his Head:

$$ e^{x} * e^{-x} = e^{x - x} = e^{0} = 1 $$

After I give Consideration to the Fact that this would violate the [Conservation-of-Energy](10000017.md), he suggest to invent a [New-Thing](60131.md), that in my new [Zero-Wave-Theory](301000002.md) I call now [Zero-Wave](10000061.md) or [Zero-Particle](10000061.md). Perhaps it can't be measured, but at least it is able to carry the missing Energy and therefore reconciles [Theory](7000001.md) with [Reality](40000.md) again.

I definitely should ask our local Theory-Expert [Professor-Hugo-Reinhard](70000066.md) (again), who is said to let only [The-Best](60151.md) come through.

Perhaps this [Idea](600012.md) is good enough for him and we can win together yet another important [Nobel-Prize](640018.md) for [Germany](140000025.md), like it e.g. recently has been achieved by [Klaus_Ferdinand_Hasselman](70000067.md).

## Day-109: The Don't-Waste-App <a id="10900"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.07.29-18:54 in Tübingen <a id="10901"/>
###### Topics: Dings-Objects, Programming

After [our](21.md#10901) Waste-Disposal-Adventure I come up with the Idea of programming a new [Quiz](280000010.md)-App about the German [Waste-Deposit-System](8030001.md), especially regarding the [Deposit-Bottles](250100002.md).

The Framework for Apps is based on so called [Dings-Objects](300040000.md), which are already available since I introduced the [Dings-Sip-Toggle](300040001.md). And for our new Baby I will use exactly the same basic Mechanisms.

Besides that, I take over the proven Design of my good-old [Vogelquiz](1971091103.md) and also reuse some of its [Media-Files](30000000.md).

Nevertheless, it took me a whole 5 Days of hard [Work](60036.md) for being able to now proudly present the second App in the Dings-System, [Ta-Da](400000053.md):

## Day-108: Bausparen with Friends <a id="10800"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.07.21-20:00 with my Banker-Friend <a id="10801"/>
###### Topics: Economics, Jokes, Programming

In [Germany](140000025.md) there is an old [Joke](720001.md) about the [Swabians](180001001.md): What is the first Word that a Swabian [Baby](40000011.md) is able to say?

$$ Answer = \mathrm{Bauuuspaaarvertrag!} $$

And besides other interesting Stuff that was the Topic of a Meeting with my [Banker-Friend](1971091154.md), who is also am Member of our [Doppel-Kopf-Crew](2010026.md). He explained me the Concept of this [Bauspar-Vertrag](130000028.md) with a simple Example:

Let's assume I want to buy a Tiny-House for 100.000 Euro and can save for this [Goal](60058.md) 10.000 Euro each Year, with simple Mathematics we can calculate my Personal-Wait-Time *PWT* until I can put the required Money on the Table:

$$ PWT = \frac{100.000\;\mathrm{Euro}}{10.000\;\mathrm{\frac{Euro}{Year}}} = 10\;\mathrm{Years} $${#10820:0}

But if I have a [Friend](180000002.md), who wants to do the same Thing, we can join our Efforts and pool the Money: After 5 Years we have together 100.000 Euro and the frist one can buy his House:

$$ 10.000\;\frac{\mathrm{Euro}}{\mathrm{Year * Friend}} * 5\;\mathrm{Years} * 2\;\mathrm{Friends} $$
$$ = 100.000\;\mathrm{Euro} $$

After another 5 Years also the second one gets his House. So interstingly by this "Financial-Trick" compared to my Personal-Wait-Time [(0)](#10820) the Average-Wait-Time [(1)](#10821) has been reduced from 10 Years to 7,5 Years:

$$ AWT = \frac{5 + 10\;\mathrm{Years}}{2} = 7,5\;\mathrm{Years} $${#10821:1}

In Order to see, how this Concept scales, I write a small [Python](9010003.md)-Program that does the Calculation from 1 to 4 Friends:

```python
# Define Constants
COSTS_PER_HOUSE      = 100000 # We can buy a House for 100.000 Coins
MONEY_PER_YEAR       = 10000  # Every Friend can save 10.000 Coins each Year
MAXIMUM_YEAR_COUNT   = 10     # In 10 Years all Houses are built
MAXIMUM_FRIEND_COUNT = 4      # Maximum Number of Friends that pool the Money

# Calculate the Sum of Years to buy all Houses
def Calculate_Wait_Time_Sum(Friends_Count):
        Wait_Time_Sum = 0
        Saved_Money = 0
        Houses = 0
        # Let's see, what we can build in 10 Years
        for Year in range(1, MAXIMUM_YEAR_COUNT + 1):
                # Calculate the saved Money per Year
                Saved_Money += Friends_Count * MONEY_PER_YEAR
                # Buy Houses with the saved Money
                while Saved_Money >= COSTS_PER_HOUSE:
                        Houses += 1
                        Saved_Money -= COSTS_PER_HOUSE
                        Wait_Time_Sum += Year
                        print(f" House %2d baught after %2d Years" % (Houses, Year))
        return Wait_Time_Sum

# Print the Results for the different Friend-Counts
def Print_Results():
        for Friends_Count in range(1, MAXIMUM_FRIEND_COUNT + 1):
                print("============ %2d Friends ============" % Friends_Count)
                Wait_Time_Sum = Calculate_Wait_Time_Sum(Friends_Count)
                print(" ==> Average Time per House: %4.1f Years" % (Wait_Time_Sum / Friends_Count))

Print_Results()
```

If you want to try out the Program by your own, copy/paste the upper Code to your favourite Python-Interpreter [[0]](#10850) and play with it, or you just trust me that the Output is as follows:

```
============  1 Friends ============
 House  1 bought after 10 Years
 ==> Average Time per House: 10.0 Years
============  2 Friends ============
 House  1 bought after  5 Years
 House  2 bought after 10 Years
 ==> Average Time per House:  7.5 Years
============  3 Friends ============
 House  1 bought after  4 Years
 House  2 bought after  7 Years
 House  3 bought after 10 Years
 ==> Average Time per House:  7.0 Years
============  4 Friends ============
 House  1 bought after  3 Years
 House  2 bought after  5 Years
 House  3 bought after  8 Years
 House  4 bought after 10 Years
 ==> Average Time per House:  6.5 Years
============  5 Friends ============
 House  1 bought after  2 Years
 House  2 bought after  4 Years
 House  3 bought after  6 Years
 House  4 bought after  8 Years
 House  5 bought after 10 Years
 ==> Average Time per House:  6.0 Years
```

Obviously this Concept works better the more Friends are involved, but when we increase the Number, it turns out that (at least with my simple Program) the average Wait-Time converges asymptotically towards 5,5 Years:

Although I studied [Economics](130000000.md) myself, up to now the [Idea](600012.md) of this [Financial-Product](130000027.md) was not clear to me, which is really shameful. One Explanation could be the questionable Quality of our [Academic-System](600000.md), the Other that back then I just was not interested in the Topic and therefore forgot it again.

## Day-105: Singing & Dings-Day <a id="10500"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.07.16-22:10 in Tübingen <a id="10502"/>
###### Topics: Dings-Day, Decisions

Up to now I counted the [Dings-Days](300000011.md) as Day-Number from the Beginning of this Project. But since in the last Weeks it happend more and more often that I did not update the Project publicly for several Days, I decide to change the Procedure and define the Dings-Day as follows:

A Dings-Day is a [Day](610006.md), where something worth mentioning is published for the [Dings-Project](300000006.md).

So from now on the Counter is always increased by one, regardless of how long ago the last Publication was made and therefore Today we have Number 105.

###### Topics: Music, Physics

Several Days ago I re-started my Singing-Lessions with a new (this Time female) Teacher. Because I told her that I would like to sing at Site, we first covered the Topic [Solmization](90000026.md), where the [Musical-Notes](90000017.md) are assigned to the following eight [Syllables](640046.md):

```
Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do
```

In order to train the different [Intervals](10000052.md), I sing the [Major-Scale](90000029.md) from the [Root](90000027.md) "Do" to some [Tone](90000028.md) and then directly back to the [Root-Tone](90000027.md) again.

In another Exercise we try to get more [Over-Tones](90000031.md) into my [Voice](60096.md). First I sing an "U", then an "Ü" and finally an "I". For the latter I notice a Ringing in my Head.

The main Reason is that the [Nasal-Cavity](40080011.md) is also a Resonance-Body that can be set into Vibration and then creates the [Over-Tones](90000031.md). Here as an Example the [Frequency-Spectrum](10000053.md) of the Tone "U" and the Tone "Ü":

###### Topics: TeX, Dings-Tool, History

For my [last](#10102) Blog-Entry I introduced into the [Dings-Project](300000006.md) the [Markup-Language](9300000.md) [TeX](9300009.md), which allows to render especially Mathematical-Symbols in a very beatiful Way.

TeX has been invented between the 1970th and 80th by the Computer-Legend [Donald_Knuth](70000040.md) and then it was used in the early 80th by [Leslie_Lamport](70000041.md) to implement his [Lamport-TeX](9300010.md) or shortly LaTeX. The latter is the most widespread today and also I have used it extensively e.g. for [my](1971092002.md) Studien-Arbeit in 1995/96:

![Regler zur Robotersteuerung](1971092002.pdf)

Here is a short TeX Code-Fragment for an [Equation](13000026.md), ...

```
$$ H = \sqrt[12]{2} \approx 1,0595 $$
```

... which is then rendered as:

$$ H = \sqrt[12]{2} \approx 1,0595 $$

A single "`$`" starts and ends the Math-Mode for TeX and a double "`$$`" is used for centered unlabled Math-Equations. Fortunately the [Pandoc-Tool](9000099.md) allows us to use these Formulas also in [Markdown](31.md)-Files.

From the different Pandoc-Options for translating [TeX](9300009.md) into [Html](9300001.md) I use the `--mathml` Option that, as the Name indicates, produces [MathMl](9300008.md) as Output.

The upper Example is translated then into the following Mathematical-Markup-Language:

```html
<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
 <semantics>
  <mrow>
   <mi>H</mi><mo>=</mo>
   <mroot>
    <mn>2</mn>
    <mn>12</mn>
   </mroot>
   <mo>=</mo>
   <mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>0595</mn>
  </mrow>
  <annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> H = \sqrt[12]{2} = 1,0595 </annotation>
  </semantics>
</math>
```

As we already saw, the rendered Result already looks quite nice, but unfurtunately there is no Support for Labeling and Referencing the Equations. Therefore I extend the Dings-Tool once more and introduce a new Syntax for appending an Anchor and  Label:

```latex
$$ TeX-Expression $${#ANCHOR:LABEL}
```


For a nice Formatting I use a [Html-Table](2000215.md) with three Columns, putting the Equation in the middle and the Anchor to the right. I also add new Css-Classes, like "TeX-Table" or "TeX-Tr" to the [Dings-Css-File](300000014.md).

The following Example ...

```latex
$$ H = \sqrt[12]{2} \approx 1,0595 $${#10480:0}
```

... is then translated into this Html-Code, ...

```html
<table class="TeX-Table">
  <tr class="TeX-Tr">
   <td class="TeX-Td-Left">
     <a id="10480"/>
   </td>
   <td class="TeX-Td-Equation">
     <math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>=</mo><mroot><mn>2</mn><mn>12</mn></mroot><mo>≈</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>0595</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> H = \sqrt[12]{2} \approx 1,0595 </annotation></semantics></math>
   <td class="TeX-Td-Right">(0)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

... that is finally rendered as:

$$ H = \sqrt[12]{2} \approx 1,0595 $${#10480:0}

Now that the All-Dings-Project is prepared for professional scientific Work, I am very excited about interesting Things that can still be explored.

## Day-101: Heimat-Programm & Pythagorean-Comma (again) <a id="10100"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.07.04-23:00 in Tübingen <a id="10102"/>
###### Topics: Music, Mathematics, Pythagorean-Comma
 
Because after on [our](#9101) Journey to Freiburg, I was not 100% sure, if my Thoughts about the [Pythagorean-Comma](90000013.md) were correct, I want to try a [Mathematics](13000000.md)-[Proof](600022.md) now.

According to [Wikipedia](190000006.md) [[0]](#10120) the Pythagorean-Comma is 23,46 [Cent](90000025.md) and in the Equal-Temperament one Cent is defined as one hundredth of a [Half-Tone](90000024.md).

Since in this System one Half-Tone is exactly one twelfth of an [Octave](90000015.md) [[1]](#10121), we have to apply to be Base-Frequency _BF_ twelve Times the [Multiplication](13000021.md) of the Frequency-Ratio of _H_ in order to reach the Octave _O_:

$$BF * H * H * ... * H * H = O$$

Because we choose $Base$-$Frequency=1$ and we already know that the Frequency-Ratio of the Octave is 2:1 or simply 2, we can write this as:

$$H * H * ... * H * H = 2$$

Using the [Exponentiation](13000022.md) we can formulate this also much shorter as:

$$H^12 = 2$$

In order to calculate _H_, we have to apply Exponentiation with $\frac{1}{12}$ on both Sides:

$$(H^{12})^{\frac{1}{12}} = 2^{\frac{1}{12}}$$

After shortening the [Fraction](13000007.md) $12*\frac{1}{12} = 1$ and replacing $2^{\frac{1}{12}}$ with the more common [Root](13000023.md)-Writing $\sqrt[12]{2}$, we get the following Frequency-Ratio for our Half-Tone:

$$H = \sqrt[12]{2} \approx 1,0595$$

As mentioned at the Beginning, according to [Wikipedia](190000006.md) the Pythagorean-Comma is 23,46 [Cent](90000025.md) and in the Equal-Temperament one Cent is defined as one hundredth of a [Half-Tone](90000024.md), so one could naively assume that we now can calculate Comma-Expected _CE_ as:

$$CE = 23,46 * \frac{1}{100} * H$$

Unfortunately it is not such simple, because in our Case we don't have a linear System. Therefore the Calculation of the Frequence-Ratio for the Half-Tone was the wrong way, sorry by bad. Instead the Frequency-Ratio _FR_ of _CT_ Cents can be calculated [[2]](#10122) with:

$$FR = 2^{\frac{CT}{1200\, Cent}}$$

The Reason for the 1200 Cent is the Octave again, that is exactly 12 Have-Tones, or $12 * 100\, Cent = 1200\, Cent$, so $2^{\frac{1200\, Cent}{1200\, Cent}} = 2^1 = 2$, which is - as we already know - the Frequency-Ratio 2:1 of our Ocatave.

So now let's calculate the Frequency-Ratio for the Pythagorean-Comma with 23,46 Cent:

$$CE = 2^{\frac{23,46\, Cent}{1200\, Cent}} \approx 1,0136$${#10141:1}

If we look at our Results for the Target-Frequencies of 12 Fiths ($1,5^{12}$) and 7 Octaves ($2^7$), our self-calculated Pythagorean-Comma _CC_ can be determinded by:

$$CC = \frac{1,5^{12}}{2^{7}} = \frac{129,75}{128,00} \approx 1,0136$${#10142:2}

Since [(1)](#10141) and [(2)](#10142) result in the same Value, my Calculation seems to be correct and even more Digits behind the [Comma](600007.md) look also quite promising:

![Pythagorean-Comma Comparison](400000037.jpg)

But I still don't have the Feeling to really have understood this [Music-System](90000001.md) completely, so probably it takes a little bit more Time until I can say "[q. e. d.](13000024.md)" with enough Confidence.

After the [Concert in Freiburg](21.md#9101), I have got the Desire to continue again with the Project-Heimat [[0]](#10102): Last Year our [Ernst-Bloch-Choir-Conductor](2010024.md) reviewed my Recordings for our [Heimat-Programm](2010025.md).

In several Hours Work I fix all the Findings and re-send the Result with the [Claim](600028.md), that now 99,9% of all [Music-Scores](90000018.md) and [Recordings](30010011.md) should be correct.

## Day-97: Embedding Dings-Files <a id="9700"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.30-21:31 in Tübingen <a id="9701"/>
###### Topics: Rendering-Process, Dings-Tool

Today I upgrade the [Rendering](9000052.md)-Process of the [Dings-Tool](300020000.md) by adding Support for embedding [Dings-Files](300000010.md) in [Markdown](31.md)-Files. For the Time being I use the same Syntax as Markdown does for Images:

```markdown
 ![CAPTION](MEDIA_FILE)
```

When the [Dings-Tool](300020000.md) generates an [Html-Page](9000097.md), it replaces this Text with appropiate Html-Code. For Example the Markdown-Code ...

```markdown
 ![Updated Rendering Process](400000034.jpg)
```

... is converted into the following [Html](9300001.md)-Code, ...

```html
<figure>
<a href="400000034.html">
  <img src="400000034.jpg" alt="Updated Rendering Process" style="100%;"/>
</a>
<figcaption>
  <a href="400000034.html">Updated Rendering Process</a>
</figcaption>
</figure>
```

... which then produces this rendered Output:

![Updated Rendering Process](400000034.jpg)

The nice Thing is that now you can click on the Image or the [Caption](700048.md) for navigating to the original Dings-File. At the Moment this works for [Jpeg](30010004.md)-Image-Files, [Mp3](30010008.md)-Sound-Files and [Mp4](30010009.md)-Video-Files.

## Day-91: Pythagorean-Comma <a id="9100"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.24-12:30 on my Way to Freiburg <a id="9101"/>
###### Topics: Pythagorean-Comma

While I am driving with my Choir-Colleages for [our](21.md#9101) Performance to Freiburg, I use the Time to investigate the [Pythagorean-Comma](90000013.md), that describes a Problem of our [Music-System](90000001.md):

If we go up 12 [Fiths](90000014.md) in the [Musical-Scale](90000016.md), we hit the same [Note](90000017.md) as if we go up 7 [Octaves](90000014.md).

But when we add the [Frequency](10000016.md)-Intervals, we come to a slightly different Result. For an Octave the Frequency doubles and for a Fifth the Frequency is multiplied by 1,5.

For calculating the Result, I write a small [Python](9010003.md)-Program, ...

```python
def Calc_Frequency(Interval, Factor, Count):
        Frequency = 1
        for Step in range(0, Count + 1):
                print(f"{Step:2d} {Interval}: {Frequency:6.2f}")
                Frequency = Frequency * Factor

Calc_Frequency("Fifhs  ", 1.5, 12)
Calc_Frequency("Octaves", 2, 7)
```

... that leads to the following Output:

```
 0 Fifhs  :   1.00
 1 Fifhs  :   1.50
 2 Fifhs  :   2.25
 3 Fifhs  :   3.38
 4 Fifhs  :   5.06
 5 Fifhs  :   7.59
 6 Fifhs  :  11.39
 7 Fifhs  :  17.09
 8 Fifhs  :  25.63
 9 Fifhs  :  38.44
10 Fifhs  :  57.67
11 Fifhs  :  86.50
12 Fifhs  : 129.75

 0 Octaves:   1.00
 1 Octaves:   2.00
 2 Octaves:   4.00
 3 Octaves:   8.00
 4 Octaves:  16.00
 5 Octaves:  32.00
 6 Octaves:  64.00
 7 Octaves: 128.00
```

Of course we can calculate the same with simple [Mathematics](13000000.md):

$1,5^{12} - r2^7 = 129,75 - 128,00 = 1,75$

But to be honest, I'm not 100% clear on the whole Problem yet, so a little more Research is probably required.

## Day-76: Responsive Web-Design <a id="7600"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.09-23:58 in Tübingen <a id="7602"/>
###### Topics: Web-Design, Favicon

Finally I added the [Dings-Favicon](300030005.md) that will be shown as Web-Site Logo in many [Web-Browsers](9000128.md).

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.09-21:32 in Tübingen <a id="7601"/>
###### Topics: Web-Design, Java-Script, Css, Html, Cookie

I spent the last Days working on the [Web-Design](2000209.md) of the Dings-[Html-Pages](9000089.md). Because my Goal is to use as much of the Screen-Real-Estate as possible, I have to apply some Techniques from [Responsive-Web-Design](2000210.md):

- [Hypertext-Markup-Language](9300001.md)
- [Cascading-Style-Sheets](9000135.md)
- [Java-Script](9010007.md)
- [Cookies](2000211.md)

I implement a [Side-Bar](2000212.md) for the Navigation within one Web-Page and a [Top-Bar](2000213.md) for Naviation within the whole Web-Site.

Initially the Side-Bar should show the [Table-Of-Contents](700023.md) of the displayed Page, which I automatically extract from the [Markdown](31.md)-File with a new Sub-Command of the [Dings-Tool](300020000.md).

For clean Reading I also want to be able to dynamically disable the Side-Bar. Because this Setting should be valid for the whole Web-Session and should not change when moving to a different Page, I use a [Cookie](2000211.md) to save the Selection-[State](60069.md).

In order to get the maximum Screen-Size for Reading I also make the Top-Bar disappear, when the User scrolls down.

For Example to dynamically build all this for the Dings-File `23.md`, I simply use the new Sub-Command of the Dings-Tool:

```bash
$ Dings-Tool Html Generate 23.md -o 23.html
```

The first Step of the [Build-Process](600044.md) extracts the Side-Bar-Content (TOC) from the Markdown-File:

![Step 1](400000011.jpg)

Then the new Side-Bar-Content is integrated into the [Dings-Html-Template](300000002.md), which produces the Pandoc-Html-Template:

![Step 2](400000012.jpg)

Finally the [Pandoc-Tool](9000099.md) is called with the new Pandoc-Html-Template and the original Markdown-File, which then generates the completed Html-File:

![Step 3](400000013.jpg)

To realize all this was a lot of Trial-and-Error [Work](60036.md), again it was more [Hacking](250000037.md) than Programming, but in the End I am halfway satisfied with the Result:

![Responsive Web-Design](400000014.jpg)

## Day-70: Hash-Functions <a id="7000"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.03-23:02 in Tübingen <a id="7002"/>
###### Topics: Hash-Function, Performance, Test

For the [Measurement](10000022.md) of the [Performance](60081.md) of the different [Hash-Functions](13000019.md) I write a small [Python](9010003.md)-Program that runs each [Hash-Algorithm](13000019.md) 32 Times on 1024 [KiB](2000203.md) of random Input-Data, so in total 512 [Mebi-Bytes](2000204.md) or 512 [Mega-Bytes](9000015.md) plus 48.576 [Bytes](9000013.md) are processed.

Then I run this Program on four different Platforms:

- On [Mac-OS](9100006.md )-12.6.2 native on [My-Mac-Book](2000002.md)
- On [Ubuntu](9100007.md)-22.04 under [Docker](9000179.md) on [My-Mac-Book](2000002.md)
- On [Ubuntu](9100007.md)-22.04 under [WSL](2000205.md) on [My-Surface-Book](1971091104.md)
- On [Ubuntu](9100007.md)-22.04 under [Docker](9000179.md) on [My-Surface-Book](1971091104.md)

Python does not implement the Hash-Functions by its own, but instead uses Standard-Libraries for that. For the latter three Setups under Ubuntu-Linux the [Open-SSL](2000206.md) Library is used, ...

```bash
root:~# openssl version
OpenSSL 3.0.2 15 Mar 2022 (Library: OpenSSL 3.0.2 15 Mar 2022
```

... and [Mac-OS](9100006.md) helps itself with the [Libre-SSL](2000207.md):

```bash
$ openssl version
LibreSSL 2.8.3
```

For Completeness I also implemented the [Digit-Sum](13000020.md) in [Python](9010003.md) ...

```python
class Csum_Class:
        def hexdigest(Self, Max_Byte = 0):
                Hex_String = hex(Self.Hash_Value)
                if Max_Byte == 0:
                        return Hex_String
                else:
                        return Hex_String[2:Max_Byte * 2]

class Add_Py(Csum_Class):
        def __init__(Self, Data):
                Data_Size = Bm.Byte(len(Data))
                Self.Hash_Value = 0
                for Byte_Nr in range(0, int(Data_Size.to_Byte())):
                        Self.Hash_Value += int(Data[Byte_Nr])
```

... and in [C](9010006.md) that can be called from my Python-Program:

```python
import Dings_Lib_C

class Add_C(Csum_Class):
        def __init__(Self, Data):
                Self.Hash_Value = Dings_Lib_C.Adder_Csum(bytearray(Data))
```
```C
static PyObject* Adder_Csum(PyObject* self, PyObject *args)
{
        unsigned long Csum = 0;
        unsigned char *Buf;
        Py_buffer Buffer;
        PyObject *Bytes;
        int i;

        if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "O|b", &Bytes))
                return NULL;

        if (PyObject_GetBuffer(Bytes, &Buffer, PyBUF_WRITABLE) < 0)
                return NULL; 

        Buf = Buffer.buf;
        for(i=0; i < Buffer.len; i++) {
                Csum += Buf[i];
        }
        PyBuffer_Release(&Buffer);
        return Py_BuildValue("l", Csum);
}
```

To make a nice Presentation of the Experiment I use the [Matplotlib](2000202.md), that allows to render my Data as a [Bar-Chart](700046.md). As Metric for the Performance-Data I show how much Mebi-Bytes per Second each Hash-Algorithm can process.

![Hash-Performance](400000010.jpg)

From the resulting Diagram, I find five Observations interesting respectively surprising:

1. My Python-Adder-Function is terribly slow.
2. The C-Adder-Function is slow on Ubuntu. 
3. In most Cases the Mac-Book seems to be much faster that my Surface-Book.
4. SHA-384 and SHA-512 run much faster on Mac-Book under Ubuntu.
5. For [MD5](2000208.md) we don't see a Speedup on Mac-Book.

Because there are a lot of Variables and Layers, it is hard to prove the real [Reasons](600030.md) for these [Observations](10000036.md), but nevertheless I would like to make some [Hypothesis](600028.md):

The interpreted [Python](9010003.md) is just much slower than compiled [C](9010006.md), although I would not have expected such a huge Impact.

On my Surface-Book probably the [CPU](9400003.md) and on Mac-Book the [GPU](9400002.md) is used, which is optimized for Hash-Generation. One Indication for this Claim is Observation 5, where I assume that the [MD5-Algorithm](2000208.md) runs on the CPU for all Platforms.

For Observation 3 my Hpyothesis is that [Open-SSL](2000206.md) provides [GPU](9400002.md)-Support, whereas [Libre-SSL](2000207.md) uses the [CPU](9400003.md).

Besides the really bad [Pyhton](9010003.md)-Performance at least one last Mystery remains: Why is the C-Adder-Function so fast on the native Mac-Book? 

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.03-23:02 in Tübingen <a id="7001"/>
###### Topics: Hash-Functions

The last Days I have dealt with the Topic [Hash-Functions](13000019.md): In [Informatics](9000000.md) you find them everywhere, for Example [Git](9000197.md) uses [SHA-1](9000196.md) or [Bitcoin](130000023.md) utilizes [SHA-256](9000199.md), which is one Member of the [SHA-2-Family](2000198.md).

The Algorithms mentioned have been developed by the [NSA](141000005.md) and standardized by the [NIST](141000006.md). Both Institutions are located in the [USA](141000004.md).

Hash-Functions are used to reduce big Numbers to small Ones. A simple Secimen for an Hash-Algorithm is the [Digit-Sum](13000020.md), where for Example the Number 4711 is mapped to the Number 13.

A Problem of [Hash-Sums](13000019.md) are the so called [Hash-Collisions](2000200.md): Since the Input-Set is bigger than the Output-Set it is unavoidable that there are two Input-Numbers that map to the same Output-Number.

Here an Example for our Digit-Sum, where the Numbers 4711 and 1003 lead both to the Number 13:

```
Digit-Sum(4711) = 13 (4 + 7 + 1 + 1)
Digit-Sum(1003) = 13 (1 + 0 + 0 + 1)
```

One Quality of a Hash-Algorithm is its [Collision-Resistence](2000201.md), which is the Likelihood that this happens.

## Day-67: Serialization <a id="6700"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.31-23:02 in Tübingen <a id="6701"/>
###### Topics: Serialization, Test

Since some Days I am pondering about how to store my own [Meta-Data](60118.md) and my prefered Solution for that is [Json](9000194.md). In order to convert hierarchical Data-Structures into a linear Representation, in [Informatics](9000000.md) a Process called [Serialization](600099.md) is used.

It would be perfect if I could directly save and load my Python-Classes with such a Process. To explore the Possibilites, I write a small Test-Programm, where I use [Dictionaries](250000018.md), [Lists](250000019.md) and [Classes](250000029.md):

```python
import json as Json

class Object_Json_Encoder_Class(Json.JSONEncoder):
        def default(Self, o):
                return o.__dict__

class Point_Class():
        def __init__(Self, x, y):
                Self.x = int(x)
                Self.y = int(y)

def Print_Dict(Dict):
        for Key in Dict:
                Value = Dict[Key]
                Type = str(type(Value))
                print(f"Key={Key}")
                print(f"  Type='{Type}'")
                print(f"  Value={Value}")

Point = Point_Class(1,2)

Test_Dict_Code = {
        "My_Integer": 4711,
        "My_String": "Test",
        "My_Point": Point,
        "My_Point_List": [ Point, Point ],
        "My_String_List": ["aa", "bb", "cc"]
}

Test_Json_String = Json.dumps(Test_Dict_Code, cls=Object_Json_Encoder_Class)
Test_Dict_Json = Json.loads(Test_Json_String)

Print_Dict(Test_Dict)
Print_Dict(Test_Dict_Json)
```

After running the Thing, I see the following Output:

```
Key=My_Integer
  Type='<class 'int'>'
  Value=4711
Key=My_String
  Type='<class 'str'>'
  Value=Test
Key=My_Point
  Type='<class '__main__.Point_Class'>'
  Value=<__main__.Point_Class object at 0x1031c6990>
Key=My_Point_List
  Type='<class 'list'>'
  Value=[<__main__.Point_Class object at 0x1031c6990>, <__main__.Point_Class object at 0x1031c6990>]
Key=My_String_List
  Type='<class 'list'>'
  Value=['aa', 'bb', 'cc']
```
```
Key=My_Integer
  Type='<class 'int'>'
  Value=4711
Key=My_String
  Type='<class 'str'>'
  Value=Test
Key=My_Point
  Type='<class 'dict'>'
  Value={'x': 1, 'y': 2}
Key=My_Point_List
  Type='<class 'list'>'
  Value=[{'x': 1, 'y': 2}, {'x': 1, 'y': 2}]
Key=My_String_List
  Type='<class 'list'>'
  Value=['aa', 'bb', 'cc']
```

Obviously some Information is lost in the Transformation-Process: The original Dictionary still knows the correct "Point_Class" [Data-Type](250000017.md), ...

```
Key=My_Point
  Type='<class '__main__.Point_Class'>'
  Value=<__main__.Point_Class object at 0x1031c6990>
```

... whereas the Dictionary that has been created from the Json-String claims that the Data-Type is a Dictionary:

```
Key=My_Point
  Type='<class 'dict'>'
  Value={'x': 1, 'y': 2}
```

And that's not a Wonder, because the Json-String does no longer contain this Information:

```
{
  "My_Integer": 4711,
  "My_String": "Test",
  "My_Point": {
    "x": 1,
    "y": 2
  },
  "My_Point_List": [
    {
      "x": 1,
      "y": 2
    },
    {
      "x": 1,
      "y": 2
    }
  ],
  "My_String_List": [
    "aa",
    "bb",
    "cc"
  ]
}
```

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.29-00:32 in Tübingen <a id="6403"/>
###### Topics: Git-Hub, Problem

Since the Afternoon, I experienced a lot of [Problems](600029.md) with [Git-Hub](9000061.md), which slowed me down significantly:

![Git-Hub Problem](400000008.jpg)

But to be fair, this is an Exception and normally it works quite well.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.28-21:47 in Tübingen <a id="6402"/>
###### Topics: Meta-Data, Sound

With [Py-Exif-Tool](9000188.md) I already could read some Meta-Data of [Mp3](30010008.md)-Files, but it is not possible to write Data. Fortunately I found [Mutagen](9000189.md):

```bash
✔ ~/All-Dings/777/Test/2023.05.28-Music-Tag [Master ↑·1|…53759] 23:23
$  pip3 install mutagen
```

With that I was able to read [Mpeg-Info](9000191.md), I could read/write [Id3](9000190.md)-Data and I also learnt that [iXML](9000192.md) exists.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.28-21:47 in Tübingen <a id="6401"/>
###### Topics: Meta-Data

Today I search for [Meta-Data](60118.md)-Libraries and for [Images](30000002.md) and find [Exif](9000182.md) and [Py-Exif-Tool](9000188.md):

```bash
✘-1 ~/All-Dings/777/Test/2023.05.28-Exif [Master|…53761] 20:00
$ pip3 install exif pyexiftool

With some Lines of Code I now can read and write the Exif-Meta-Data of [Jpg](30010004.md)-Files.

Today I search for free [Pattern-Recognition](60119.md)-Libraries and find [OpenCV](9000182.md), [Tensor-Flow](9000184.md) as well as [DeepFace](9000185.md):

```bash
✘-1 ~/All-Dings/777/Test/2023.05.27-Open-CV [Master|…53752] 19:24

###### Topics: Kivy, Windows, Dings-App

So now let's switch to [Windows](9100002.md), where I first have to create a virtual Environment again (important):

```bash
$ python -m venv My-App
$ cd My-App
```

Then I build the Py-Installer-Spec-File:

```bash
~/My-App$ python -m PyInstaller --onefile --name Dings-App ..\..\Dings_App\main.py
```

Then I add some Lines to the Config-File, that the App-Files and Libraries are included in the EXE-File:

```bash

###### Topics: Kivy, iOS, iPad, Dings-App

Today I want to run the [Dings-App](300000020.md) on iOs, therefore I first install the kivy-ios Package:

```bash
~/All-Dings$ pip3 install kivy-ios
```

Then I create a Build-Directory:

```bash
~/All-Dings$ mkdir kivy-build
```

Next I use the Tool-Chain-Command to build required Libraries and Stuff:

```bash
~/All-Dings/kivy-build$ toolchain build python3 kivy openssl
```

After that I have to install the required Python-Modules for my App:

```bash
~/All-Dings/kivy-build$ toolchain pip install pygments docutils
```

Then I create the X-Code Project with the Tool-Chain-Command:

```bash
~/All-Dings/kivy-build$ toolchain create Dings_App ~/All-Dings/777/Dings_App/
```

Note, that for this Step only the required Files should be in the `Dings_App` Directory, e.g. remove the `.buildozer` Directory before.

Finally I start X-Code with the Open-Command, ...

```bash
~/All-Dings/kivy-build$ open dings_app-ios/dings_app.xcodeproj/
```

... and then run the App on my [iPad](20000012.md):

Now the Question is what Options I have to program for [Android](9100003.md), [iOS](9100004.md), [Windows](9100002.md) and [Linux](9100005.md). Up to now I know three Candidates:

- [Kivy](9000166.md)
- [Unity](9000180.md)
- [Flutter](9000181.md)

The first two I already tried, so perhaps I will check out Flutter next?

After three hours work on Mac and on Windows, I gave up the Idea to build the APK using a [Docker](9000179.md)-Image.

###### Topics: Kivy, Buildozer, Android, APK

After I followed the Instructions to create the Pong-App, I want to create an [Android](9100003.md) [APK-Package](404.md). So let's first install the [Builddozer](9000174.md) Packaging-Tool:

```bash
(kivy_venv) ✘-1 ~/All-Dings/777/Test/2023.05.23-Kivy/Pong [Master|…8] 17:45
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip buildozer
```
```
Requirement already satisfied: pip in /Users/michael-holzheu/All-Dings/111/kivy_venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages (23.1.2)

```

Then I create a [Buildozer-Spec-File](9000175.md) ...

```bash
(kivy_venv) ✔ ~/All-Dings/777/Test/2023.05.23-Kivy/Pong [Master|…8] 17:47
$ buildozer init
```
```
File buildozer.spec created, ready to customize!
```

... and cutomize it:

```bash
(kivy_venv) ✔ ~/All-Dings/777/Test/2023.05.23-Kivy/Pong [Master|…10] 17:49
$ diff -Nau buildozer.spec.orig buildozer.spec
```

```

To build an [Android-APK-Package](9000176.md) I have to install the [Cython](9000178.md)-Tool first:

```bash
(kivy_venv) ✘-1 ~/All-Dings/777/Test/2023.05.23-Kivy/Pong [Master|…10] 18:00
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade cython

```

Then I build the Android-Package with the [Bildozer](9000174.md)-Tool, ...

```bash
(kivy_venv) ✔ ~/All-Dings/777/Test/2023.05.23-Kivy/Pong [Master|…10] 18:00
$ buildozer android debug deploy run
```

... which seems to be a *very* long an complicated Procedure, ...

```

... that finally hangs in an Endless-Loop:

```

```

But at least the APK-Package seems to have been built:

```bash
(kivy_venv) ✔ ~/All-Dings/777/Test/2023.05.23-Kivy/Pong [Master|…52203] 18:23
$ find . | grep apk
```
```
./bin/pong-0.1-arm64-v8a_armeabi-v7a-debug.apk
```

I can also install the Package on my [S22-Ultra](20000001.md), but unfortunately it crashes.

###### Topics: Kivy, Layouts

As I already know form my [Android](200400004.md)-Development of our [Bird-Quiz-App](1971091103.md) also [Kivy](9000166.md) provides different [Layouts](9000171.md) for Positioning and Scaling [Widgets](9000170.md), for Example:

- Grid-Layout
- Relative-Layout
- Stack-Layout

Kivy provides Properties that can notify Subscribers about Change-[Events](600085.md) using the [Observer-Pattern](9000167.md):

```python

    numeric_var = NumericProperty(1)
```

###### Topics: Kivy, Test

With the following Command I run the first Demo:

```bash
(kivy_venv) ✘-2 ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering L|✚ 1…2] 14:52
$ python3 kivy_venv/share/kivy-examples/demo/showcase/main.py
```

The Web-Page shows a simple Demo Program, ...

```bash
(kivy_venv) ✔ ~/All-Dings/777/Test/2023.05.23-Kivy [Master|…8] 14:59
$ cat Test-1.py
```
```python 
import kivy
kivy.require('2.1.0') # replace with your current kivy version !

from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.label import Label


class MyApp(App):

    def build(self):
        return Label(text='Hello world')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    MyApp().run()
```

... that can be simply run with:

```bash
(kivy_venv) ✔ ~/All-Dings/777/Test/2023.05.23-Kivy [Master|…8] 14:59
$ python3 Test-1.py

###### Topics: Prize, Diligence, Saying

While chatting with [Thomas](1971091150.md) on a [Html](9300001.md)-Issue, I whined about the [Complexity](600023.md) of getting a nice [Layout](700017.md) for all the possible [Devices](20000000.md) like [PCs](20000009.md), [Smart-Phones](20000005.md), [Tablet-Devices](20000007.md), and so on.

After he sent me as Reply the German-[Saying](200100000.md) "Ohne [Fleiß](41000003.md) kein [Preis](60114.md)!", I used the Opportunety to show him my [Diligence](41000003.md) with the [Unix-Wc-Command](9000156.md):

###### Topics: Image-Magicks, Graphics-Magick, Gimp-Fu-Script

Today I make a short Programming-Break and look for Options how to efficiently handle Images in my Project, I investigate three Options:

- Image-Magics
- Graphics-Magics
- Gimp-Fu-Script

The [Gimp-Tool](9000053.md) is already installed on my Mac and fortunately also the two Others can be installed Out-of-the-Box:

```bash
✔ ~/All-Dings/111/0 [Master ↓·14|…4] 22:04
$ history | grep brew
 1610  brew install graphicsmagick
 1616  brew install imagemagick
```

Graphics-Magick comes with the Gm-Tool ...

```bash
✔ ~/All-Dings/111/0 [Master ↓·14|…4] 22:10
$ gm -help
```
```

###### Topics: Python, Programming-Study

I took the [Debugging](9000044.md) of a Problem as an Opportunity to start a [Programming-Study](302030000.md), where I want to collect noteworthy Observations regarding Programming-Languages.

In my second interesting Case these two Lines ...

```pyhton
def Help(Self):
    Command_Name = Self.Command_Name()
```

... lead to the following [Error](60074.md):

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/michael-holzheu/All-Dings/111/0/300020001.py", line 166, in <module>
    Main()
  File "/Users/michael-holzheu/All-Dings/111/0/300020001.py", line 164, in Main

    Command_Name = Self.Command_Name()
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TypeError: 'str' object is not callable
```

The Reason is that in my [Class](250000029.md) a [Class-Variable](250000035.md) `Command_Name` is defined ...

```python
## Command Base-Class
class Command:
        Command_List = {}
        Command_Name = ""
```

... and also an [Object-Method](250000030.md) with the same Name:

```python
def Command_Name(Self):
    return To_Mixed_Case(Self.Name.replace('_', ' '))
```

Interestingly the following similar Code ...

```python
class Dings:
        My_Class_Variable = "Test"
        def __init__(Self):
                print("Init")
        def My_Class_Variable(Self):
                print("Should this work?")
        def Do_It(Self):
                print(Self.My_Class_Variable)
                Self.My_Class_Variable()

## Create Object
My_Dings = Dings()
## Call Function directly (OK)
My_Dings.My_Class_Variable()
## Call Function within Class (FAIL)
My_Dings.Do_It()
```

... only produces a [Warning](600047.md):

```
Init
Should this work?
<bound method Dings.My_Class_Variable of <__main__.Dings object at 0x1025c0350>>
Should this work?
```

I worked the whole Day on the Dings-Tool, but since I am still a Beginner in Python, it was more [Hacking](250000037.md) than [Programming](250000000). Well at least I got it somehow working.

###### Topics: Dings-Lib, Inheritance, Class-Hierarchy

I extend the Code once again and use the Concepts [Inheritance](250000027.md) from the [Object-oriented-Paradigm](250000026.md), both [Perl](9010001.md) and [Python](9010003.md) have Support for that.

Three [Sub-Classes](250000032.md) e.g. `Code_To_Markdown` are defined for the [old](#3701) [Base-Class](250000033.md) `Code_To_Markdown`.

BTW, [Class-Hieraries](250000034.md), like all other [Trees](600066.md) in the [Informatics-System](9999999.md), are normally shown with the [Root](60110.md) on Top:

```

Here a Code-Snipped from the Perl-Version:

```perl
# Convert Python-Code ot Markdown
package Python_To_Markdown;
use base 'Code_To_Markdown';

sub new {
        my $Class = shift;
        my $Self = $Class->SUPER::new(@_);

        $Self->{'Reg_Exp_Heading'} = '^' . '#+' . ' ' . '.*';
        $Self->{'Reg_Exp_Comment'} = '^' . '"""' . '\s*';
        return $Self;
}
```

And here the corresponding Python Variant:

```python
# Convert Python-Code ot Markdown
class Python_To_Markdown(Code_To_Markdown):
        def __init__(Self):
                Self.Reg_Exp_Heading = re.compile('^' + '#+' + ' ' + '.*')
                Self.Reg_Exp_Comment = re.compile('^' + '"""' + '\s*')
                super().__init__()
```

I use the Class-Hierarchy for [Sharing](60111.md) the Method `Process_Line()` of the Base-Class that then calls the specific Methods of its Sub-Classes:

```python
def Process_Line(Self, Line, Line_Number):
        Line = Line.rstrip()
        if Self.State == Self.States.Init:
                Self.Handle_State_Init(Line)
        elif Self.State == Self.States.Heading:
                Self.Handle_State_Heading(Line)
        elif Self.State == Self.States.Code:
                Self.Handle_State_Code(Line)
        elif Self.State == Self.State.Comment:
                Self.Handle_State_Comment(Line)
        return Self.State
```

###### Topics: Dings-Lib, Programming-Paradigm, Programming-Class

Today I extended my [Dings-Lib](300010000.md) with some Code that follows the [Object-oriented-Paradigm](250000026.md), both [Perl](9010001.md) and [Python](9010003.md) have Support for that.

I defined a new [Class](250000029.md) `Code_To_Markdown` together with a [Constructor](250000031.md) and some [Methods](250000030.md) like e.g. `Process_End()`.

Here a Code-Snipped from the Perl-Version:

###### Topics: Dings-Lib, Python, Bug, Type-Inference, Sorting, Programming-Study

While completing my [Functions](250000003.md) for Reading and Printing all my Dings, I notice that my [Code](9000039.md) does not sort the Number-Files correctly:

```bash
✔ ~/All-Dings/111/0 [Master ↑·1|✚ 4…5] 18:20
$ python3 300010010.py
```
```

99 "Coincidence"
9999997 "Informatics-Famous-Human"
9999998 "Informatics-Student"
9999999 "Informatics-System"
```

First I assumed the Problem is in the [Python-Sorted-Function](250020001.md) and then with the Help of [Chat-GPT](9000150.md) even wrote my own [Quick-Sort](250000022.md)-Function:

```python
## Quick-Sort for List of Dictionary
def Quicksort_List_of_Dictionary(List, Key):
        Element_Count = len(List) 
        if Element_Count <= 1:
                return List
        Pivot = List[Element_Count // 2][Key]
        Left = [Element for Element in List if Element[Key] < Pivot]
        Middle = [Element for Element in List if Element[Key] == Pivot]
        Right = [Element for Element in List if Element[Key] > Pivot]
        return Quicksort_List_of_Dictionary(Left, Key) + Middle + Quicksort_List_of_Dictionary(Right, Key)
```

Unfortunately the Problem was not solved by simply replacing the Sorting-Function. After over one Hour of [Debugging](9000044.md) I the found the [Problem](9000148.md) in the following Code:

```python
## Read Data of a Number-File
def Read_Number_File(File_Name):
        with open(os.path.join(Dings_Directory, File_Name), 'r') as File:
                First_Line = File.readline()
        Name = Name_Regex.sub(r'\1', First_Line)
        Number = Number_Regex.sub(r'\1', File_Name)

        ### Define new [Dictionary](250000018.md) for Number-File
        Number_File = {}
        Number_File['Number'] = Number
        Number_File['Name'] = Name.strip()
        return Number_File
```

Besides of my own Ignorance, the [Reason](600030.md) for the Bug is located in the [Type-Inference](250000020.md)-Feature of [Python](9010003.md), which automatically concludes that `Number_File['Number']` is a [String](250000023.md).

The [Compare-Operators](13000017.md) for Strings use [Alphabetic-Order](640036.md) and therefore regarding [Sorting](600090.md) the Following is a true [Statement](600078.md):

```
9300006 < 99 <  9999997
```

The [Bug-Fix](9000154.md) for the Problem is to use the [Cast-Operator](250000024.md) so that Python knows that each Number should be interpreted as [Integer-Type](250000021.md):

```bash
✔ ~/All-Dings/111/0 [Master|✚ 1…6] 18:40

```

###### Topics: Privacy, Todo

While debugging [the](#3502) Python-Problem, my Artist-Friend calls me and we have a long Discussion about my Project. In particular the Fact that currently all Information is public scares my Colleague.

I understand his Problem, but of course this is Nothing new: Big Companies like [Google](240000009.md) or [Facebook](240000010.md) already store Loads of Information and most likely create more or less anonymous [User-Profiles](9000140.md).

The Difference is that my User-Profiles are public and with all the [Connections](60006.md) Everybody can get potential dangerous Information.

Although I normally ask People, if I am allowed to create a Number-File like e.g. for [My-Tennis-Win-Friend](1971091140.md), there are also implicite Profiles:

For Example after reading [my](21.md#3403) Bus-Driver-Story someone could find in real Life the young Man, who compared the Mood of the People in [Tübingen](2000001) and [Reutlingen](140000037.md). Since there are not many Bus-Drivers in Tübingen that are 22 Years old, the [Search](600091.md) is probably not very difficult.

Therefore in the worst Case Information of my Project could be harmful.

Because I don't have a good [Answer](600024.md) to that [Problem](600029.md) up to now, I put the Topic [Privacy](670008.md) to [my](9.md) Todo-List and take it upon myself to be as careful as possible for the Time being.

###### Topics: Programming, Python, Perl, Regular-Expression, Compatibility

Let's come back to the Topic [Programming](250000000) again: I have now two [Implementations](600033.md) of the same [Algorithm](250000006.md). In Theory with the same [Input](60042.md) the same [Output](60017.md) should produced by the Perl- and the Python-Program, so let's give it a Try:

```bash
✔ ~/All-Dings/111/0 [Master ↓·41|✚ 1…4]  21:37
$ perl 300010011.pl > out.perl
✔ ~/All-Dings/111/0 [Master ↓·41|✚ 1…5] 21:37
$ python3 300010010.py  > out.python
```

Then we use the [Unix-Diff-Command](9000155.md) to ensure that the two Output-Files have the same [Content](600040.md):

```bash
✔ ~/All-Dings/111/0 [Master ↓·41|✚ 1…6] 21:37
$ diff out.perl out.python
```
```
1,1021c1,2041
< 0 "Michael_Holzheu"
< 1 "Clash of Clans Erster Geburtstag "
< 2 "Clash of Clans: Erster Geburtstag"

[8<Snip>8]

---
> 0 "Michael_Holzheu
> "
> 1 "Clash of Clans Erster Geburtstag 
> "
> 2 "Clash of Clans: Erster Geburtstag

[8<Snip>8]
```

All Lines marked with `<` belong to `out.perl` and those with `>` to `out.python`. It looks like that the Pyton-Output contains one additional [New-Line](700026.md) at the End.

I extract the [Dings-Name](300000016.md) from a [Number-File](300000010.md) using [Regular-Expressions](9000103.md) and BTW, at leasst [Chat-GPT](9000150.md) claims that the Concepts for those Expressions have been developed in the 1950s by [Stephen_Cole_Kleene](70000016.md).

So let's look first at the Perl Version, ...

```perl
my $Heading_Regex = qr/^#\s+(.*)$/;
```

... and then at the Python Variant:

```python
Name_Regex = re.compile(r'^#\s+(.*)$')
```

Besides of the surrounding Stuff, both Lines are identical and the extracted Regular-Expression is as Follows:

```
^#\s+(.*)$
```

Looks like that the [Implementations](600033.md) of Regular-Expressions are different in Perl and Python, to prove that I extract the Code into two Test-Files:

```bash
✔ ~/All-Dings/Test 23:27
$ cat regex-test.pl
```
```perl
my $Heading_Regex = qr/^#\s+(.*)$/;
my $File_Name = "0.md";
open my $File, '<', $File_Name;
$First_Line = <$File>;
printf("\"%s\"\n", $First_Line);
$First_Line =~ /$Heading_Regex/;
printf("\"%s\"\n", $1);
```
```bash
✔ ~/All-Dings/Test 23:27
$ cat regex-test.py
```
```python
import re

Name_Regex = re.compile(r'^#\s+(.*)$')
with open("0.md", 'r') as File:
	First_Line = File.readline()
print(f'"{First_Line}"')
Name = Name_Regex.sub(r'\1', First_Line)
print(f'"{Name}"')
```

Then I run both against my `0.md`-File:

```bash
✔ ~/All-Dings/Test 23:29
$ head -3 0.md
```
```
# Michael_Holzheu

<img src="0.jpg" alt="Michael_Holzheu" style="width:256px; height: 256px;"/>
```

And the Result is the Proof:

```bash
✔ ~/All-Dings/Test 23:31
$ perl regex-test.pl > out.perl
✔ ~/All-Dings/Test 23:31
$ python3 regex-test.py > out.python
✔ ~/All-Dings/Test 23:31
$ diff out.perl out.python 
3c3,4
< "Michael_Holzheu"
---
> "Michael_Holzheu
> "
```

So the Perl Regular-Expression seems not to match the [New-Line](700025.md), whereas Python includes it.

A Work-Around for this [Compatibility](600092.md)-Problem is to use the Python `Strip`-Function that removes the trailing White-Space before we apply the Regular-Expression:

```bash
✔ ~/All-Dings/Test 23:56
$ diff -Nau regex-test.py regex-test-strip.py 
```
```
--- regex-test.py	2023-04-28 23:55:20.000000000 +0200

 Name = Name_Regex.sub(r'\1', First_Line)

```

Finally I have to add a Strip-Function also to my Perl-Version:

```bash

###### Topics: Chat-GPT, Graph-Structure

Today I would like to print the [Graph-Structure](600087.md) of all my current Things, but because I am lazy, I ask [Chat-GPT](9000150.md) for Help:

```
Write a program that prints a graph graphically
```

```
Sure, here's an example Python program that reads in a graph represented as an adjacency list and prints out its graphically using the networkx and matplotlib libraries:

import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define a function to read in a graph from a file
def read_graph(filename):
    # Create an empty dictionary to hold the graph
    graph = {}


[...]
```

Then I install the two required Libraries, ...

```bash

## Day-32: Information-Mapping <a id="3200"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.25-14:15 in Tübingen <a id="3201"/>
###### Topics: Dings, Information-Mapping

Since several Days I think about a good Mechanism, how to share [Information](60007.md) between [Documents](700001.md). IMHO, in Principle there are three different Ways to do that:

- Reference Information
- Include Information
- Copy Information

#### Reference Information <a id="3203"/>

We could create a new Document that uses a Direct-Reference on the above Information, ...

```markdown
# Document about Including Information

Michael_Holzheu wrote that there are [three](23.md#3201) Ways of sharing Information.
```

... or we could use an Indirect-Reference:

```markdown
# Document about Including Information

Michael_Holzheu wrote that there are three Ways of sharing Information [[1000]](#1000).

## References

[<a id="1000"/>1000] [About-Dings-Share-Information](23.md#3201)
```

#### Include Information <a id="3204"/>

We could build a Mechanism that allows to include Sections 1:1 into other Documents, e.g. with some Include-Statement we could import this Blog-Entry in our new Document. At least for Images this already works for [Markdown](31.md), where the `!-Character` is used for the Include-Statement:

```markdown
# Document about Including Information

Michael_Holzheu wrote the following:

![About-Including-Information](23.md#3201)
```

#### Copy Information <a id="3205"/>

Finally we can of course manually copy the Information:

```markdown
# Document about Including Information

Michael_Holzheu wrote that there are [three](23.md#3201) Ways of sharing Information:

- Reference Information
- Include Information
- Copy Information
```

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.25-14:15 in Tübingen <a id="3210"/>
###### Topics: Information-Sharing, Internet, Xanadu, Virtual-Mapping

So, [after](#3201) thinking a little bit about Information-Sharing Theory, let's have a Look on the History of [Internet](9000152.md):

The British Man [Tim_Berners-Lee](70000014.md) invented [HTML](9300001.md) that provides [Hyper-Links](9300003.md) for Referencing Information in the [World-Wide-Web](9300004.md).

A Link can be specified as follows:

```html
<a href="https://holzheu.de/">Web-Site from Michael_Holzheu</a>
```

Like with Markdown, there seems to be no native Mechanism [[3211]](#3211) in HTML to include other HTML-Pages, but interestingly including Pictures is possible:

```html
<img src="0.jpg" alt="Michael_Holzheu"/>
```

The US Man [Ted_Nelson](70000015.md) suggested an Alterntive to the Ideas of [Tim_Berners-Lee](70000014.md) and implemented the [Xanadu-System](9300005.md), which is able to include Information in other Documents using so-called [Transclusion](404.md), where the Data is copied only at [Rendering](9000052.md)-Time.

The Concept of Transclusion is a very wide-spread Thing that is called Mapping in Virtualization, e.g. the following three Examples immediately come into my Mind:

- Mappings with the [MMap-Unix-System-Call](404.md)
- References in [Spread-Sheets](700038.md)
- Include-Files in [Programming-Languages](9010000.md)

Here a small Diagram that illustrates the Concept of Virtual-Mapping at the Example of two different Virtual-Documents that are constructed out of three "real" Objects:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                         |
|       Virtual-1          Real           Virtual-2       |
|                                                         |
| +-------------------+             +-------------------+ |
| |     Object-3      |  Object-1   |     Object-1      | |
| |                   |             |                   | |
| |     Object-2      |  Object-2   |     Object-2      | |
| |                   |             |                   | |
| |     Object-1      |  Object-3   |     Object-3      | |
| +-------------------+             +-------------------+ |
|                                                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

Advantages of Virtual-Mappings:

- Resource-Consumption: The References require less Ressources than the real Objects
- Consistency: When a real Object is changed, all virtual Objects automatically get the Update

Disadvantages of Virtual-Mappings:

- External-References: When mapping a real Object also all of its External-References have to be somewhere mapped in the Virtual-Document.
- Reference-Relocation: If References have a Local-Name they have to be renamed in the Virtual-Document, this Process is also Sometimes called Rellocation.
- Resource-Consumption: The Resolution of References in the Rendering-Process also takes some Time.
- Consistency: When one Physical-Object is updated and the Meaning changes, the overall Consisteny in the Virtual-Document still have to be ensured somehow.

## Day-31: Chat-GPT <a id="3100"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.24-15:40 in Tübingen <a id="3111"/>
###### Topics: Chat-GPT, Perl

I heard that Chat-GPT can also write Program-Code, so let's try:

```
Michael: Write perl code for quicksort
```
```
Chat-GPT: Sure, here's an implementation of quicksort in Perl:
```

```perl
sub quicksort {
    my @arr = @_;
    if (@arr <= 1) {
        return @arr;
    }
    my $pivot = $arr[int(@arr/2)];
    my @left = grep { $_ < $pivot } @arr;
    my @middle = grep { $_ == $pivot } @arr;
    my @right = grep { $_ > $pivot } @arr;
    return (quicksort(@left), @middle, quicksort(@right));
}
```

The Code looks good and even an Example-Program is provided, ...


```console
✔ ~/All-Dings 15:43
$ tail -4 Quick-Sort.pl
```
```
my @my_list = (4, 2, 7, 1, 3, 5, 6);
my @sorted_list = quicksort(@my_list);
print join(", ", @sorted_list), "\n";
```

... that seems to work:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings 15:44
$ perl Quick-Sort.pl
```
```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
```

###### Topics: Underscore, Hyphen, Decisions

After I already had a bad Feeling with my [Yesterday](#2801)'s Work, I now decided to revert the first Idea of using the [Underscore](700034.md) as [Word_Separator_Character](700036.md).

I my new Idea is to use the Underscore for Names like [Roxana_Stanciu](1997080300.md) and the [Hyphen](600008.md) for all combinded Things like 

First I manually edit the [Dings-File](0.txt) and then use the following Script to change all Names:

```bash
cat 0.txt | awk '{print $2}' | grep - | while read -r Dings; do if [ "$Dings" != "" ]; then Old_Dings=$(echo $Dings | sed -E 's/-/_/g'); echo "$Old_Dings -> $Dings"; sed -i '' 's/$Old_Dings/$Dings/g' *.md; fi; done
```

But to remember the History, I would like to keep my two Blog-Files unchanged:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111/0 [Master|✚ 3] 20:11
$ git checkout 23.md 
Updated 0 paths from the index
✔ ~/All-Dings/111/0 [Master|✚ 3] 20:11
$ git checkout 21.md 
Updated 0 paths from the index

Then I realized that my current [Naming_Convention](650011.md) to use [Hyphens](600008.md) as [Word_Separator_Character](404.md) is suboptimal for (Programming_Languages)[9010000.md]. Therefore I decided with a heavy [Heart](404.md) to exchange all the `-`-Characters with their `_`-Counter_Parts.

###### Topics: Abbreviation, Decisions

Then I introduce for each [Discipline](7000003.md) an [Abbreviation](210000000.md), for Example [Math_System](13000016.md) instead of [Mathematics_System](13000016.md), but [TBH](210000003.md) I am not really sure if that [Decision](60095.md) is a good [Idea](600012.md).

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.21-21:50 in Tübingen <a id="2803"/>
###### Topics: Abbreviation, Decisions

Maybe even my [penultimate](#2801) Decision was wrong:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111/0 [Master ↓·2|…1] 21:53
$ cat 1971099001.md
```
```
# michael-holzheu@Git_Hub

###### Topics: Entscheidungs-Problem

After I already added a lot of Information from [Wikpedia]() to some [Personalities]() ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111/0 [:9c9ff24|…1] 22:51
$ cat 70000007.md
```
```
# Alonso_Church

Alonso_Church is a [Math_Personality](13000015.md), [Logics_Personality](15000002.md) and [Philo_Personality](645002.md), who is born in the [United_States](141000004.md).
```

... I decided to remove it again:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111/0 [Master|…1] 22:53
$ git show 50ff27551d9785377183817d5dd7a1a7956e3038 70000007.md
```

The [Reasoning](600049.md) is that [IMHO](210000004.md), there is a [Entscheidungs_Problem](600084.md), if a [Human](40000001.md) really is a [Personality](70000000.md) or not, so better ...

###### Topics: All-Dings, Performance

The last Days I noticed that the Generation of the All-Dings-File always took longer and besides there are also [Bugs](9000148.md) in my [Bash-Script](404.md):

```console

```

So let's use a better [Algorithm](250000006.md) that gives us better [Performance](60081.md):

```console

On a Smoking-Round I decided to change the Name of my new Identity to [Doktor-Holzheu](1971091177.md), which is according to my [old](5.md#10000) [Rule](60053.md).

But then I extended the [Scope](600074.md) from [Medical-System](800014.md) to [Academics-System](600000.md), which would change the [Meaning](60002.md) of the [Number-File](300000010.md).

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.16-15:41 in Tübingen <a id="2301"/>
###### Topics: All-Dings

I now concretized the Handling of the [All-Dings-Repositories](404.md):

- **[Repository-File](404.md):** The [Repository-Number](404.md) is also for the Repository-File, for Example the `0-Repository` uses `0.md`, or more generally speaking the Repository-File has the Name `REPOSITORY-NUMBER.md`.
- **[Git-Hub-Readme-File](404.md):** Since on Git-Hub the `README.md` is used as [Landing-Page](700020.md) for the Git-Repository, I create a [Soft-Link](9000078.md) from `README.md` to the Repository-File.
- **[Naming-File](404.md):** For each Repository we have a Naming-File with the Name `REPOSITORY-NUMBER.txt`, which describes the Mapping between Numbers and Names.

So for our `0-Repository` it now looks like the Following:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111/0 [Master ↓·4|✚ 2…1] 15:49
$ ls -l 0.*
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    427 16 Apr 14:30 0.md            <--- Repository-File
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  18839 16 Apr 15:06 0.txt           <--- Naming-File
✔ ~/All-Dings/111/0 [Master ↓·4|✚ 2…1] 15:49
$ ls -l README.md 
lrwxr-xr-x  1 michael-holzheu  staff  4 16 Apr 14:51 README.md -> 0.md   <--- Git-Hub-Readme-File
```

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.16-18:40 in Tübingen <a id="2303"/>
###### Topics: All-Dings

After I organized the Naming-File in the `0-Repository` I think about where to store the Things that are required by all other Repositories.

The Best I can think of now is to move all to the `Rendering-Repository`:

```
## 111 About-Rendering-Repository

1000001.md     Blog-Chain-Time

300000008.md   All-Dings-Abbreviation-Character
300000007.md   All-Dings-System
300000006.md   All-Dings-Landing-Page
300000004.make All-Dings-HTML-Make-File
300000003.md   All-Dings-HTML-Make-File
300000002.html All-Dings-HTML-Template-File
300000002.md   All-Dings-HTML-Template
300000001.md   All-Dings
300000000.md   Blog-Chain

5.md           All-Dings-Rules
23.md          About-All-Dings

300001000.make Rendering-Makefile  
300000007.md   All-Dings-Rendering-Repository

17.md          All-Things
111.md         About-Rendering-Repository
```

But now the next Problem arises: If I do this, I would change the Meaning of the `Rendering-Repository` and consequently I should  rename it to `All-Dings`.

Somehow I don't like this, because my Idea up to now was that the Numbers are made for [Eternaty](40001.md) and Changing the Meaning of a Number-File would conceptually be the same as Changing its Number.

So until I am more clear on this Question I leave the All-Dings-Things in the `0-Repository` and hope that good Ideas arrive soon.

While showing my Buddy the current Naming-File, we stumbled across the Word [Waiter](202000001.md), which triggered a short Discussion about [Gender-Separation](270000001.md) in the All-Dings Project. My current Approach for this this Problem is to use as neutral as possible Terms for all my Things.

        for Git_Sub_Module in $(git submodule | awk '{print $2}')

                Old_Tag=$(git tag -l | grep $Tag)
                cd $Git_Sub_Module
                git pull origin Master
                git checkout Master
                git pull --rebase

                if [ "$Old_Tag" != "" ]; then
                        git tag -d $Tag
                fi
                git push origin :refs/tags/$Tag

✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Master|✚ 2…1]  01:29
$ Tag=Day-21; for Git_Sub_Module in $(git submodule | awk '{print $2}'); do cd $Git_Sub_Module; git pull --rebase; git tag -d $Tag; git push Origin :refs/tags/$Tag; git tag $Tag; git push --tags; cd ..; done
Already up to date.
```

After I finished [Day-19](#1900) and had three last Cigarettes, I realized that I deleted my [Perl-Scripts](#1699) by Accident:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings  00:28
$ find . | grep dings
```

That means **a lot of** Work is lost and I have to think about, how to save unfinished Work in my Project ...

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.13-12:30 in Tübingen <a id="2010"/>
###### Topics: Programming

After the Tennis-Training I decided to use this Day for Programming. To speparate Things, I create for this a new Programming-Repository with the Number `250000000`.

I would like to re-write the lost Perl-Programm, and use the Opportunity to compare the two Programming-Languages [Perl](9010001.md) and [Python](9010003.md).

For local Work on my Mac-Book-Pro I first install the Python-3-Package:

```console
✘-1 ~/All-Dings/1000001000 [Master ↓·1|✚ 1]  12:34
$ brew install python
```

Then I create two new Number-Files in the Programming-Repository:

- Perl-Basics: 250010000.pl
- Python-Basics: 250020000.py

To separate Things even more, I create a new Blog-File for this Project:

- Programming-Basics: [250000001.md](250000001.md)

The first Thing when learning a Programming-Language is the [Hello-World-Program](250000002.md), which should print the Message `Hello World!` to the Screen.

But before we do that, we have to learn two other Concepts, namely [Program-Comments](250000004.md) and [Program-Functions](250000003.md).

At least the first one is quite simple, ...

```console
18:06
$ cat 250000004.md
# Program-Comment

A Program-Comment is used be a [Programm-Writer](202000006.md) to explain his [Program](250000005.md).
```

... but when I wanted to describe, what a Program-Function exectly is, I went from a Hundred to a Thousand:

```
# Program-Function
A Program-Function uses a [List](60008.md) of [Program-Statements](250000007.md) to transform [Program-Parameters](250000009.md) into [Program-Output](50000014.md).

# Program
A Program is the [Implementation](600057.md) of an [Algorithm](250000006.md).

# Algorithm
An Algorithm is a [Description](600056.md) for as [Solution](600024.md) of a given [Problem](600029.md).

# Program-Statement
A Program-Statement is the smallest non devisable [Element](700006.md) of a [Programming-Language](9010000.md)

# Program-Variable
A Program-Variable has a [Name](60048.md) and contains [Data](60001.md).

# Program-Parameter
A Program-Parameter is used to pass [Data](60001.md) from the [Program-Caller](250000010.md) to the [Program-Callee](250000011.md) by creating a new [Name-Binding](60050.md) that gives the [Program-Caller](250000010.md) some kind of [Access](60049.md) to the Data.

# Program-Caller
The Program-Caller gives [Program-Control](250000012.md) to a [Program-Callee](250000011.md).

# Program-Callee
A Program-Callee receives [Program-Control](250000012.md) from a [Program-Caller](250000010.md).

# Program-Control
Program-Control defines which Part of a [Program](250000005.md) executes [Program-Statements](250000007.md) at a given Time.

# Program-Executer
A Program-Executer processes the [Program-Statements](250000007.md) of a [Program](250000005.md) according to the [Specification](600060.md) of the [Programming-Language](9010000.md).

# Program-Output
Program-Output is [Data](60001.md) that is created by a [Program](250000005.md).

# Program-Input
Program-Input is [Data](60001.md) that is transfered to a [Program](250000005.md)
```

So a Program-Function uses a [List](60008.md) of [Program-Statements](250000007.md) to transform [Program-Parameters](250000009.md) into [Program-Output](50000014.md).

Hmm, sounds more like the Definition of a Program, so let's check, what I have written for that Thing:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/250000000 [main|✔] 
18:16
$ cat 250000005.md
# Program

A Program is the [Implementation](600057.md) of an [Algorithm](250000006.md).
```

Well that is of course also true for a Function ...

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.13-12:09:48 in Tübingen <a id="2011"/>

On my Smoking-Round I came to a Conclusion for the Program-vs-Function-Question: Every Function is a Program, but at a different [Nesting-Level](600064.md). It is somehow like with a [Russian-Matrjoschka](140100001.md) where one Thing contains the next one.

But our Situation is a bit more complex that with the Russian Lady, who always has a 1:1 [Relation](60005.md) between the different [Container](600063.md)-Ladies.

So maybe a better [Analogy](60055.md) would be a the [Human-Body](40080000.md), that contains many [Organs](40100000.md), that contain many [Cells](40090000.md) and so on.

So let's create some [Ascii-Art](60000002.md) [[0]](#2020) and draw first the [Tree-Diagram](700027.md) that shows a small Part of our Computer-Matrjoschka:

```
                    ┌──────────────┐
                    │   Program    │
                    └──────┬───────┘
                           │
        ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
        │                  │                  │
        ▼                  ▼                  ▼
┌───────────────┐  ┌───────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐
│  Function-A   │  │  Function-B   │   │   Function-C  │
└───────────────┘  └───────────────┘   └───────────────┘
```

And finally look at the same Thing using a [Set-Diagram](700031.md):

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Process                                              │
│ ┌───────────────┐ ┌───────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ │
│ │  Function-A   │ │  Function-B   │ │  Function-C  │ │
│ └───────────────┘ └───────────────┘ └──────────────┘ │
│                                                      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Day-19: Consistency <a id="1900"/> 
###### Topics: Programming

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.12-17:23 in Tübingen, Yesterday I was thinking on the Problem, how to reference Information in my Documents.

References have two Elements, namely the Anchor that marks the Location of an Information and a Link from another Document that adressess that Anchor.

In Markdown there is the Concept of local Links that are automatically created [[0]](1910) for each Heading. Unfotunately it looks like that there is no common [Standard](60047.md), how the Anchors are created.

Let's use the following Heading as Example:

```
#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.12-14:46 in Tübingen
```

I found a Web-Page that automaticall creates the following Link for this Heading:

```
[Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.12-15:28 in Tübingen](#blog-chain-time-20230412-15-28-in-t-bingen)
```

So it creates out of the Heading-String `Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.12-15:28 in Tübingen` the Anchor `blog-chain-time-20230412-15-28-in-t-bingen`.

Unfortuately the Git-Hub Markdown assumes a different Anochor for the Heading, namely `blog-chain-time-20230412-1446-in-tübingen`, and therefore the generated Link does not work.

I this Project for Addressing of Number-Files we already use its Number, so my new Idea is to also that Concept for [Addressing](600053.md) of Information within Documents. I still want to use the automatic Anchor-Generation of Markdown, therefore I decide to use a Heading with Level 6 (`###### NUMBER`) as explicite Anchors.

But when I saw the rendered Result it looked very messy. So finally I used the invisible `<a>` [Html-Tag](9000137.md) as Anchor:

```
<a name="10002"></a>
#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.12-15:14 in Tübingen
```

Then I added to each [Blog-Entry](700024.md) a [Topic](600051.md) using a Level-6-Heading:

```
<a name="10002"></a>
#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.12-15:14 in Tübingen
###### Topics: Clothing, Riddle
```

After done that, I render all Pages to Html and realize the next Problem:

```
## 2023.04.12

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.12-14:46 in Tübingen ###### Topics: Clothing, Geography, Justice
```

Perhaps the Pandoc-Tool does not like Level-6-Headings? Let's create a Test-File, ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering L|✚ 1…1096] 19:28
$ cat test.md
# Level 1
## Level 2
### Level 3
#### Level 4
#### Level 5
##### Level 6
###### Level 7
```

... convert it with Pandoc into Html, ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering L|✚ 1…1096] 19:28
$ pandoc --standalone --template 300000002.htm test.md -o test.html
```

... and check the Output:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering L|✚ 1…1096] 19:30
$ cat test.html 
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <style>
	pre {
		background-color: #F8F9FA;
		border-style: solid;
		border-color: #A1AAB1;
		border-radius: 4px;
		padding: 5px;
	}
    </style>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="date" content=''>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
<h1 id="level-1">Level 1</h1>
<h2 id="level-2">Level 2</h2>
<h3 id="level-3">Level 3</h3>
<h4 id="level-4">Level 4</h4>
<h4 id="level-5">Level 5</h4>
<h5 id="level-6">Level 6</h5>
<h6 id="level-7">Level 7</h6>
  </body>
</html>
```

Obviously the Problem is the Html-Tag in front of the Markdown-Heading:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering L|✚ 1…1096] 19:34
$ cat new-test.md 
<a name="10002"></a>
#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.12-14:46 in Tübingen
###### Topics: Clothing, Geography, Justice
```

As a Quick-Fix I found that putting the Html-Tag within the Heading worked:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering L|✚ 1…1096] 19:37
$ cat latest-test.md 
#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.12-14:46 in Tübingen <a name="10002"></a> 
###### Topics: Clothing, Geography, Justice
```

Like so often in Informatics you try around until it works, but back to the Concepts:

Currently we have three different Types of [Information-Containers](7000002.md):

- Repositories
- Number-Files
- Documents

Repositories contain Number-Files, Number-Files contain Documents, Documents contain e.g. Blog-Entries [[1]](#1911). We have the following Addressing for every Piece of Information that we can use for [References](60039.md) from other Information:

- Repository-Number
- Number-File-Number
- Html-Tag-Number

The first two Numbers currently are unique in the Scope of this Project, but the Html-Tag-Number is only unequivocal within the Document.

What makes the Things even more complicated is the Fact that Information Containers can change over Time. So when we e.g. reference a Blog-Entry from another Blog-Entry, after some Days the Content of the first one could have canged, which then makes the Reference from the second one somehow invalid.

There are several Solutions to that Problem:

1. Use a Time-Stamp in the Reference
2. Use a Hash-Value for the Information in the Reference
3. Don't use References and instead copy the Information
4. Try to keep the whole Project consistent at one Point in Time

My current Approach to solve the Problem of [Consistency](600054.md) is Solution 4. Therefore I try make one Day as consistent as possible. With Git it is still possible to checkout and render old Days. So if you are interested in the [Truth](600021.md) of the [Past](10000019.md) you still can find it.

And if some Information changes or moves, I try my best to update all the References in the Project so that the current Day is halfway consistent again.

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.12-22:48, I now updated this Document with Html-Tags and Links.

To save Time and Space I use now a [Self-Closing-Tag](9300002.md) as Anchor:

```
## Day-19: Consistenty <a id="1900"/>
```

Seems to work, but I did not understand everything ...

[<a id="1911"/>1] BTW, what I have just written on Information-Containers is also not 100% correct, because Number-Files could also be Repositories again, which makes the Bit-Mess even bigger.

## Day-18: Connect Repositories 1  <a id="1800"/>
###### Topics: Programming

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.11-12:27 in Tübingen, As already Yesterday I gave up the Concept of a single Repository that contains all Number-Files.

I now create a new Repository for my Problem with the Medical-Psychological-Assessments and use the Number `1000001000` for the Landing-Page. So now I have four Repositories:

```
### 1000001000

1000001000     About-Medical-Psychological-Assessment

### 888

1000000000.jpg Nicole-and-Michael-in-Metzingen
888.md         Metzingen-with-Nicole

### 111

300001000.make Rendering-Makefile  
300000007.md   All-Dings-Rendering-Repository
17.md          All-Things

### 0

300000008.md   All-Dings-Abbreviation-Character
```

Since I want to use the Landing-Page also for the Git-Hub Readme-File, I create a Unix-Hard-Link:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/1000001000 [main|✚ 1] 13:06
$ rm README.md
```

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/1000001000 [main|✚ 1] 13:06
$ ln 1000001000.md README.md
```

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/1000001000 [main|✚ 1] 13:06
$ git diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index 13bd927..865d4b1 100644
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md
@@ -1 +1,3 @@
-# About Medical-Psychological-Assessment
+# About-Medical-Psychological-Assessment
+
+Document that describes the Medical-Psychological-Assessment Process.
```

Then I create also for the other Repositories the Landing-Pages and move the Sorted-Things Number-File from the `0-Repository` to the `111-Repository`:

```
### 1000001000

1000001001     Medical-Psychological-Assessment
1000001000     About-Medical-Psychological-Assessment

17.md          All-Things
111.md         About-Rendering-Repository

### 0
```

### Number-Files Moves

I now have moved several Number-Files between Repositories, which adds Complexity and makes it harder to keep the Overview on all my Things.

For Example, to get the full History of a Number-File, we have to check all Repositories:

```console
✘-1 ~/All-Dings/0 [Master ↓·3|…1] 15:27
$ for Repository in $(ls ..); do (cd ../$Repository; git log --pretty="format:%ci %h %s" -- 300000007.md;) ; done  
2023-04-10 20:53:40 +0200 1650178 Move 300000007.md from 0-Repository to 111-Repository
2023-04-08 19:38:28 +0200 71a7fdf Add All-Dings-Rendering-Repository
2023-04-10 23:22:08 +0200 6b79a5e Add Repository Links
2023-04-10 20:50:40 +0200 b61bf6e Move 300000007.md from 0-Repository to 111-Repository
```

The Number-File `300000007.md` first lived in the `0-Repository` ...

```console
✘-1 ~/All-Dings/0 [Master ↓·3|…1] 15:33
$ git log --pretty="format:%ci %h %s" -- 300000007.md
2023-04-10 20:53:40 +0200 1650178 Move 300000007.md from 0-Repository to 111-Repository
2023-04-08 19:38:28 +0200 71a7fdf Add All-Dings-Rendering-Repository
```

... and then was moved into the `111-Repository`:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Master ↓·3|…1] 15:26
$ git log --pretty="format:%ci %h %s" -- 300000007.md
2023-04-10 23:22:08 +0200 6b79a5e Add Repository Links
2023-04-10 20:50:40 +0200 b61bf6e Move 300000007.md from 0-Repository to 111-Repository
```

Now let's look for a Bash-Script to find out in which Repository-Number we currently are:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Master ↓·3|…1] 15:44
$ git remote -v | grep -E ".*[0-9]+\.git" | head -1 | sed -E 's#.*Dings/([0-9]+)\.git.*#\1#g'
111
```
 
#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.11-04:57 <a id="1699"/>

After I have decided to solve this Problem with a Perl-Script I have developed a Prototype, that almost works:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Master|…8] 04:58
$ perl Dings.pl Log 300000007.md 
0          300000007.md 2023.04.08-19:38:28 71a7fdf6078684bba76ad77ac366960ba1615474 Add All-Dings-Rendering-Repository

```

## Day-17: Rendering 3 <a id="1700"/>
###### Topics: Programming

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.10-15:56 in Tübingen, Let's work Today again on the Rendering Idea.

Currently the HTML-Pages look really Old-Shool and for getting a bit more Style into the Show, the so called [Cascading-Style-Sheets](9000135.md), or shortly CSS have been invented.

For adding a Light-Grey Background with rounded Borders to our Code-Blocks, I first test different Options using the W3-Schools Web-Site [[0]]((1610) and then finally add the following CSS-Code to the All-Dings-HTML-Template-File:

```console

### Integrate 888-Repository

Up to now my Accroach to integrate the different Git-Repositories was to use Git-Submodules, but now I am pursuing another Idea. Therefore I delete the `0-Repository-Submodule` in the `888-Repository`:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 18:20
$ git rm 0/ && git commit -m "Remove 0-Repository-Submodule" && git push
rm '0'
[Master 63ee1c5] Remove 0-Repository-Submodule

Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To github.com:All-Dings/888.git
   348b73d..63ee1c5  Master -> Master
```

My new Concept is to maintain different Repositories that all contain globally unique Numbers for their Files. In a daily Rendering-Process I then want to combinde the Content of all Repositories using the Rendering-Repository.

### Combine in Rendering-Repository

For the Rendering-Repository I would like to add now all known All-Dings-Repositories using Git-Submodules again.

First I create a empty new Branch using the Git-Checkout-Command with the `--orphan` Option:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|✔] 19:49
$ git checkout --orphan Master
Switched to a new branch 'Master'
```

As expected the Branch has no Commits:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Master L|●995] 19:50
$ git log
fatal: your current branch 'Master' does not have any commits yet
```

First let's get rid of the old Files from the Rendering-Branch using the Git-Reset-Command and the Git-Clean-Command:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Master L|…1] 20:00
$ git reset && git clean -fx
```

Then we add the `0-Repository` as first Sub-Module, ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Master L|…1] 20:01

The same Thing is done with Nicole's `888-Repository`. Then I replace the `REAMDE.md` from the `888-Repository` with `888.md` from the `0-Repository`:

```console

BTW, with this I give up the Concept that all Numbers are available in the `0-Repository`. Instead now each Number-File can move between the `All-Dings-Repositories`.

The same Thing is then done for the Number-File `300000007.md` with the Name `All-Dings-Rendering-Repository`:

```console

```

Now I update the Git-Submodules in the `Rendering-Repository`:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Master L|✔] 20:51
$ cd 0 && git pull && cd .. && cd 888 && git pull && cd ..
```

```console
✘-1 ~/All-Dings/111 [Master L|✔] 20:56
$ git add -u && git commit -m "Update Git-Submodules" && git push Origin Master
```

Now I would like to combine the Files of the `0-Repository` with the `888-Repository` using [Unix-Hard-Links](9000136.md) and therefore I create another Make-File:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Master L|…511] 21:43
$ cat 300001000.make
# Rendering-Makefile
#

## Git-Sub-Module Number-Files

## Create-Hard-Link-Rule

%: */%
	ln  $< $@

## Clean-Rule

clean:
	rm -f $(Number_File_List_Local)

.PHONY: all clean
```

After all the Number-Files from the `0-Repository` and the `888-Repository` now are all in the same Directory, I create the HTML-Files by calling the already known [All-Things-Make-File](300000004.make):

```bash

Now let's add the first Photo to the `888-Repository`:

```
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|…2] 22:18

 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 1000000000.jpg
```

Then I add it to the Readme-File, but it is not displayed on Git-Hub. The Reason is again the Soft-Link `.github/README.md`. Therefore I repentantly copy back the Readme-Files for all Repositories:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master|…1] 22:41
$ cp .github/README.md .
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master ↓·3|…2] 22:42
$ git rm .github/README.md 
rm '.github/README.md'
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master ↓·3|●1…2] 22:42

```

But now I have to remove in the Make-File the REAMDE.md from Number_File_List_Local:

```console

### Render merged Repositories

Now let's build a new `Rendering-Branch`:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Master|✔] 22:59
$ git branch -d Rendering

Now we have pushed the merged Rendering of the `0-Repository` and the `888-Repository`, looks good!

### Footnotes

## Day-16: Rendering 2 <a id="1600"/>
###### Topics: Programming

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.09-09:13 in the S-Bahn to Stuttgart, I look into the [Phishing](600046.md)-[Warning](600047.md) from Yesterday.

Interestingly the [Symptom](600048.md) of the [Problem](600029.md) depends on the [Web-Browser](9000128.md): With the [Chrome-Web-Browser](9000129.md) the Phishing-Error-Page is loaded and the [Safari-Web-Browser](9000130.md) shows my [Sorry-Page](404.md).

My [Hpyothesis](600028.md) is that the new Soft-Link to the Readme-File triggers this Problem.

### Revert Soft-Link Changes?

First let's check the Git-History with the Git-Log-Command using the `--oneline` Command-Option that creates compact Output using shortened 8-Character-Git-Hashes:


```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master ↓·20|…1] 09:54
$ git log --oneline .github/README.md 
6df58b0 Move README.md -> .gitconfig/README.md
02c9f3e Remove Soft-Link again
1e740d0 Add Soft-Link 888.md -> README.m
```

To undo the changes I first try the [Git-Revert-Command](9000131.md), ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master|…1] 10:01
$ git revert 6df58b0 
Auto-merging 300000006.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in 300000006.md
error: could not revert 6df58b0... Move README.md -> .gitconfig/README.md
hint: After resolving the conflicts, mark them with
hint: "git add/rm <pathspec>", then run
hint: "git revert --continue".
hint: You can instead skip this commit with "git revert --skip".
hint: To abort and get back to the state before "git revert",
hint: run "git revert --abort".
```

... that fails, because the Commit touches a File that has been changed in the Meantime, so let's abort this Approach:

```console
✘-1 ~/All-Dings/0 [Master|REVERTING|●2✖ 1…1] 10:03
$ git revert --abort
```

In the Meantime I changed my Plan and now I want to generate the Readme-File at Rendering-Time using our [Makefile](#all-things-makefile-file) from Yesterday.

### Readme-File at Rendering Time

#### Add Sub-Routine

First I move the Markdown-To-Html Conversion Code into a seperate [Sub-Routine](9000132.md) `Markdown_to_Html`:

```bash
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master ↓·1|✚ 1…437] 10:42

        rm -f $(Html-File-List
```
#### Create Web-Server-Directory-Index-Rule

Then I create a Makefile-Rule to create the [Web-Server-Directory-Index](9000133.md)-File, Today I am brave and try first [Mixed-Case]() `Index.html`:

```console
11:35 $ git diff

```

#### Test Web-Server-Directory-Index-Rule

Now I switch to the `Rendering-Repository` and switch to the Branch for the `0-Repository` using the Git-Checkout-Command:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|…1] 11:37
$ git checkout All-Dings.0-Master
Switched to branch 'All-Dings.0-Master'
Your branch is up to date with 'All-Dings.0/Master'.
```

Because I don't like the hard to remember [Git-Branch](9000069.md)-Name `All-Dings.0-Master`, I change it with the Git-Branch-command to `0-Master`:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [All-Dings.0-Master|…1] 11:37
$ git branch -m 0-Master
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [0-Master|…1]
```

With the same [Reasoning](600049.md) I also rename the Git-Remote `All-Dings.0` to `0` with the Git-Remot-Command:

```console
11:55 $ git remote rename All-Dings.0 0
Renaming remote references: 100% (1/1), done
```

Then I get the latest Update from the `0-Repository` with the Git-Fetch-Command, ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [0-Master ↓·43|…1] 11:55
$ git fetch 0
remote: Enumerating objects: 9, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (9/9), done.

From github.com:All-Dings/0
   82d3cf1..f4f5c3f  Master     -> 0/Master
```

... and use the Git-Pull-Command to get the new Files:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [0-Master ↓·45|…1] 12:01
$ git pull 0 Master
From github.com:All-Dings/0

```
 
Then I switch to the `Rendering`-Git-Branch using the Git-Checkout-Command:
 
```console
 ✘-1 ~/All-Dings/111 [0-Master|…1] 12:02
 $ git checkout Rendering
Switched to branch 'Rendering'
Your branch is based on 'Origin/main', but the upstream is gone.
  (use "git branch --unset-upstream" to fixup)
```

Now it's time to pull the latest Updaes from the `0-Repository` into the `Rendering`-Git-Branch unsing the [Git-Rebase-Command](9000119.md):

```console
✘-128 ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|…1] 12:07

Now we have the Makefile-Changes in our `Rendering`-Git-Branch:

Html-Files: $(Html-File-List)

	$(call Markdown_to_Html, $<, $@)

```

So let's create the [Html-Files](9000134.md) using the [Make-Command](9000100.md), ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|…1] 12:11
$ make -f 300000004.make
```

... add them to the Git-Index and then push them:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|●16…1] 15:37
$ git commit -m "Render Files" && git push -f Origin Rendering

As expected the Mix-Case `Index.html` is ignored by the Webserver, so we have to use [Lower-Case](650013.md) `index.html`:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|…1] 15:47
$ git mv Index.html index.html && git commit -m "Use Lower-Case" && git push -f Origin Rendering

Now the Phishig-Warning is removed useing the Git-Pages-Url [[0]](1420) for the `111-Repository` we see with any Web-Browser the Readme-File.

## Day-15: Rendering 1 <a id="1500"/>
###### Topics: Programming

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.08-14:59 in Tübingen, I have the [Intuition](60040.md) or [Feeling](60041.md) that the Idea with Git-Submodules and Git-Hub-Pages was not a good one.

The new Idea is to use the [Pandoc-Tool](9000099.md) to render each Day the the Content of the [All-Dings](300000001.md)-Repositories.

According to a nice How-To [[1]](1351) I first create for an [All-Dings-Html-Template](300000002.md).

Then I create the [All-Dings-Html-Makefile](300000003.md) that should control the [Rendering](9000052.md)-Process.

The [Make-Command](9000100.md) is a widely used [Tool](600043.md) for [Automation](600042.md) in the Informatics.

### All-Things-Makefile-File

Now I write the first [Makefile-Rules](9000101.md) to create Html-Files out of all the Markdown-Files:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master ↓·10|✚ 2…387] 16:13
$ cat 300000004.make 
# # All-Things-Makefile-File
#

Md-File-List = $(wildcard *.md)
Html-File-List = $(subst .md,.html,$(Md-File-List))

all: Html-Files
	echo "All-Things-Makefile-File"

Html-Files: $(Html-File-List)

%.html: %.md
	pandoc --standalone --template 300000002.html $< -o $@

.PHONY: all
```

Then I trigger the first [Build-Process](600044.md):

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master ↓·12|✚ 1…2] 16:17
$ make -f 300000004.make
pandoc --standalone --template 300000002.html 0.md -o 0.html
[WARNING] This document format requires a nonempty <title> element.
  Defaulting to '0' as the title.
  To specify a title, use 'title' in metadata or --metadata title="...".
pandoc --standalone --template 300000002.html 1.md -o 1.html
[WARNING] This document format requires a nonempty <title> element.
  Defaulting to '1' as the title.
  To specify a title, use 'title' in metadata or --metadata title="...".
  
[...]

[WARNING] This document format requires a nonempty <title> element.
  Defaulting to 'README' as the title.
  To specify a title, use 'title' in metadata or --metadata title="...".
echo "All-Things-Makefile-File"
All-Things-Makefile-File
```

This creates a lot of new Html-Files:

```

In order to be able to distinguish e.g. `All-Dings-Html-Makefile` from the generated [Output](60043.md)-Files, I decide to use the alternative [File-Suffix](9000102.md) `.htm` instead of `.html` for the [Input](60042.md)-File.

The Output-Files look almost good, ...
```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master ↓·5|…395] 16:44

<p>I am called <a href="4.md">Holyheu</a> in the Clash of Clans World,
but my real Name is Michael Holzheu.</p>
<p>My <a href="700018.md">Movies</a> can be seen on the You-Tube-Channel

<li><code>1971.XX.XX-XX:XX</code> I am born.</li>
</ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

... but the References are not working because they still point to the Markdown-Files:

```
I am called <a href="4.md">Holyheu</a>
```

Because I do not find a Pandoc-Tool Option for automatic Conversion, I want to write a [Regular-Expression](9000103.md) for the [Unix-Sed-Tool](9000104.md) to replace the File-Suffix `.md` with `.html`.

But first make a more simple Experiment, where I use a [Unix-Pipe](9000024.md) to redirect the Output of the Cat-Command to the Input of the Sed-Tool and then replace the [String](9000105.md) `I am` with the new String `We are`:

```console
✘-1 ~/All-Dings/0 [Master|…395] 16:55
$ cat 0.html | sed -E 's/I am/We are/g'
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<li><code>1971.XX.XX-XX:XX</code> We are born.</li>
</ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

Replacing the File-Suffix is only a little bit more complicated:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master|…395] 16:58
$ cat 0.html | sed -E 's/(href="[0-9]+)\.md/\1\.html/g'
<!doctype html>

<li><code>1971.XX.XX-XX:XX</code> I am born.</li>
</ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

After some Experiments I come up with the following Solution:

```console
17:17 $ cat 300000004.make
# # All-Things-Makefile-File
#

Md-File-List = $(wildcard *.md)
Html-File-List = $(subst .md,.html,$(Md-File-List))

all: Html-Files
	echo "All-Things-Makefile-File"

Html-Files: $(Html-File-List)

%.html: %.md
	pandoc --standalone --template 300000002.htm $< -o $@
	sed -i '' -E 's/(href="[0-9]+)\.md/\1\.html/g' $@

clean:
	rm -f $(Html-File-List)

.PHONY: all clean
```

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.08-18:11 in Tübingen, My [Plan](600045.md) is to create a new Rendering-Repository that contains the latest Content and the Idea is to use Git-Pull-Force to update it.

But first I want to replace the [REAMDE-File](9000109.md) with a new [All-Dings-Landing-Page](300000006.md), which can be done with by creating a [Unix-Soft-Link](9000078.md) in the [Git-Hub-Config-Directory](9000106.md):

So I first we create the `.github` [Directory]()9000019.md with the [Unix-Mkdir-Command](9000075.md), ...

```console
19:21 $ mkdir .github
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master|…2]
```

... then use the [Unix-Mv-Command](9000108.md) with the `-f` [Short-Command-Option](9000085.md) to force the Move of the old [Readme-File](9000109.md), ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master|…2] 
19:21 $ mv -f README.md 300000006.md
```

... afterwards we remove the old Readme-File with the [Git-Rm-Command](9000114.md), ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master|✚ 2…2] 
19:22 $ git rm README.md
rm 'README.md'
```

... then change into the `.github` directory with the [Unix-Cd-Command](9000114.md), ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master|●1✚ 1…2] 
19:22 $ cd .github/
```

... and create a [Unix-Soft-Link](9000078.md) using the [Unix-Ln-Command](9000077.md) with the [Short-Command-Option](9000110.md) `-s`, ...

```console
✘-1 ~/All-Dings/0/.github [Master|●1✚ 1…2] 
19:23 $ ln -s ../300000006.md README.md
```

... use the [Git-Add-Command](9000111.md) to add the Changes to the [Git-Index](9000116.md), ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0/.github [Master|●1✚ 1…3] 
19:24 $ git add ../300000006.md README.md
```

... then fire up the [Git-Commit-Command](9000112.md) with the [Long-Command-Option](9000110.md) `--message` to create a new [Git-Commit](9000070.md) with a meaningful [Git-Commit-Message](9000117.md) ...

```
✘-HUP ~/All-Dings/0/.github [Master|●3…2] 
19:24 $ git commit --message "Move README.md -> .gitconfig/README.md"
[Master 6df58b0] Move README.md -> .gitconfig/README.md
 3 files changed, 456 insertions(+), 458 deletions(-)
 create mode 120000 .github/README.md
 delete mode 100644 README.md
```

... and finally publish the Changes with the [Git-Push-Command](9000113.md):

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0/.github [Master ↑·1|…2] 
19:27 $ git push

```

### Create All-Dings-Rendering-Repository

Now we create our [All-Dings-Rendering-Repository](300000007.md) which get a meaningful Number regarding Unix-Output:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings 
19:40 $ git clone git@github.com:All-Dings/111.git
Cloning into '111'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
```

First let's rename the Git-Remote according to our current [Naming-Conventions](650011.md):

```console
✘-HUP ~/All-Dings/111 [main L|✔] 19:43
$ git remote rename origin Origin
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [main L|✔]
```

Then initialize the new Repository with the [Git-Init-Command](9000118.md) ...

```console
✘-128 ~/All-Dings/111 [main L|✔] 19:51
$ git init
Reinitialized existing Git repository in /Users/michael-holzheu/All-Dings/111/.git/
```

... and create a new Git-Branch `Rendering`:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [main L|✔] 19:58
$ git branch -M Rendering
```

Now we add a new Git-Remote for our `0-Repository` ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering L|✔] 19:59
$ git remote add All-Dings.0 git@github.com:All-Dings/0.git
```

... and check our Git-Remotes with the Git-Remote-Command using the `--verbose` Long-Command-Option:

```console
20:02 $ git remote --verbose
All-Dings.0	git@github.com:All-Dings/0.git (fetch)
All-Dings.0	git@github.com:All-Dings/0.git (push)
Origin	git@github.com:All-Dings/111.git (fetch)
Origin	git@github.com:All-Dings/111.git (push)
```

First we have to download the Contenst of the `All-Dings.0` Git-Remote into our local Repository using the [Git-Fetch-Command](9000200.md):

```console
✘-128 ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering L|✔] 20:07
$ git fetch All-Dings.0
remote: Enumerating objects: 3443, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (378/378), done.

 * [new tag]         Day-9      -> Day-9
```

Finally we download all the Content from the `All-Dings.0/Master` using the Git-Pull-Command:

```console
20:12 $ git pull All-Dings.0 Master

remote: Counting objects: 100% (8/8), done.

```

Looks like we have a Problem with my Photo that I originally have commited using [Git-Lvs](666.md). So as a [Workaround](20.md) disable LFS for the Time beeing ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|✔] 20:54
$ git lfs install --skip-smudge
Updated Git hooks.
Git LFS initialized.
```

... and then try it again:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering L|✔] 20:54
$ git pull All-Dings.0 Master
From github.com:All-Dings/0
 * branch            Master     -> FETCH_HEAD
```

Looks like we have almost everything:

```console

Now let's push all to the Git-Remote-Branch `Rendering`:

```console
✘-1 ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|✔] 21:04
$ git push -f Origin Rendering
Git LFS upload failed:   0% (0/1), 0 B | 0 B/s

hint: You can disable this check with: `git config lfs.allowincompletepush true`

```

Well LFS Problem again, but at least it tells me, how to "fix" this Issue:

```console
✘-1 ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|✔] 
21:05 $ git config lfs.allowincompletepush true
```

So one more Time:

```console
21:05 $ git push -f Origin Rendering

What about Removing our [Problem-Child](40000005.md):

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|✚ 1] 
21:11 $ git rm 8.jpg && git commit -m "Remove Problem-Child"
rm '8.jpg'

```

One more Time:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|✔] 
21:11 $ git push -f Origin Rendering
Git LFS upload missing objects:1), 0 B | 0 B/s

```

Searching in the Internet I find a "Solution" [[2]](1352) for the Problem. Although it will rewrite the [Git-History](9000120.md), I'll give it a Chance:

```console
✘-2 ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|✔] 21:16
$ git lfs migrate export --everything --include 8.jpg
[3e2ed1738c2bc76d70e344d93acddfe45ed6edbf1b462ac92b657f7dea7949a3] Object does not exist on the server: [404] Object does not exist on the server
```

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.08-21:15 in Tübingen, I really want to finish this Today, so I try the next "Solution" [3]:

```console
✘-2 ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|✔] 21:16
$ git lfs push Origin --all
```

At least this worked without an Error, so one more Time:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|✔] 21:23
$ git push -f Origin Rendering
Git LFS upload missing objects:1), 0 B | 0 B/s

This somehow reminds me to a Holiday with Nicole in Romania [[0]](1350), buts let's stay professional and look in the `0-Repository` for the bad LFS-Commit:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master ↓·3|…3] 21:46
$ git log 8.jpg 
commit df322ecea6b01efb9dc4e02e0aaf3d8771fe5875 (tag: Day-0)
Author: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
Date:   Sat Mar 25 03:51:04 2023 +0100

    Add initial content
    
    Signed-off-by: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
```

With the [Git-Diff-Command](9000084.md) I see this Commit does not only contain the 8.jpg File:

```console
21:50 $ git diff --stat df322ecea6b01efb9dc4e02e0aaf3d8771fe5875 | head -5
 .github/README.md |    1 +
 .gitignore        |   16 +
 0.md              |   16 +-
 1.md              |    8 +-
 100.md            |    3 +
```

But interestingly it does not show our Problem-Child:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master ↓·3|…3] 21:51
$ git diff --stat df322ecea6b01efb9dc4e02e0aaf3d8771fe5875 | grep 8.jpg
```

### LFS Fix-Idea

Now I get the Idea to build my Render-Branch by using the [Git-Cherry-Pick-Command](9000121.md) for the "good" Commits and manually apply the "bad" LFS-Commit.

So I first get the Git-History of the `0-Repository` using the Git-Log-Command:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master ↓·6|…4] 
22:02 $ git log --pretty=format:"%H" > history.txt
```

Using the [Unix-Head-Command](9000123.md) on the File, we can see the [Git-Hashes](9000122.md) for every Commit:

```console
22:03 $ head -n 3 history.txt 
bd97114cefeb0752fd3a08caa34dc301bf9fe1c2
cdf60668c83df30a64fcd915b0378754f8d61b49
1f69fecb240f5e0215cc09384da905f9b8d51504
```

The first Hash `bd97114cefeb0752fd3a08caa34dc301bf9fe1c2` belongs to our last Commit:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master ↓·8|…4] 22:06
$ git show bd97114cefeb0752fd3a08caa34dc301bf9fe1c2
commit bd97114cefeb0752fd3a08caa34dc301bf9fe1c2 (HEAD -> Master)
Author: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
Date:   Sat Apr 8 21:10:08 2023 +0200

    Add Problem-Child

Using the [Unix-Tail-Command]() we see that the Bad-Commit was in fact my very first Commit:
 
 ```console
 ✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master|…7] 22:30
 $ tail -n 3 history.txt 
ea9b913566434e6aeee9ec92025d4825e88e5c1c

df322ecea6b01efb9dc4e02e0aaf3d8771fe5875
```

So now let's got back in History to this very first Commit by first using the [Git-Checkout-Command](9000071.md):

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Master|…7] 22:30
$ git checkout df322ecea6b01efb9dc4e02e0aaf3d8771fe5875
Note: switching to 'df322ecea6b01efb9dc4e02e0aaf3d8771fe5875'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at df322ec Add initial content
```

Now we are back in History ...

```console
22:47 $ git log

✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Day-0|…1] 22:39
$ ls
0.md		11.md		2.md		4.md		6.markdown	7.md		8.md		README.md
1.md		12.md		3.md		5.md		6.md		8.jpg		9.md
```
 
Now we manually copy all the Files over to the `111-Repository` using the [Unix-Cp-Command](9000124.md) ...

```console
22:39 $ cp * .gitattributes ../111/
✔ ~/All-Dings/0 [Day-0|…1]
```

... and then try to recreate the Commit with the Git-Add- and Git-Commit-Command:

```
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering L|✔] 
22:55 $ git add * .gitattributes && git commit -s -m "Add initial content"

 Although I did exactly the same Steps as 14 Days ago, the two Commits differ in Time and in the Git-Hash:
 
 ```console
 ✔ ~/All-Dings 22:57

Now I get the current History ...

```console

$ git log --pretty=format:"%H" > ../history.txt
```

... reverse the Order using the [Unix-Nl-Command](9000125.md), the Unix-Sort-Command(9000126.md) and the Unix-Cut-Command(9000127.md): 

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|…1] 23:08

... and apply it using the [Git-Cherry-Pick-Command](9000121.md):

```console

Then let's build the Html-Pages ...

```console

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/111 [Rendering|…1] 23:22

```

Then we use our Web-Browser and enable Git-Hub-Pages under Settings->Pages ...

```

... then click on `Save` and afterwards trigger the Built of the Git-Hub-Pages with an empty Commit:

## Day-14: Git-Hub-Pages <a id="1400"/>
###### Topics: Programming

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.07-19:31 on my Way to Nicole, I continue working on the Sub-Module 404 Problem from Yesterday.

My new Idea is to use [Git-Hub-Pages](9000096.md).

It is possible to automatically generate [Html-Pages](9000097.md) out of the [Markdown](31.md) Files.

After I have enabled this on the `0-Repository` and the `888-Repository` it looks promising:

- 0-Repository: [https://all-dings.github.io/0](https://all-dings.github.io/0)
- 888-Repository: [https://all-dings.github.io/777](https://all-dings.github.io/777)

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.07-20:31 in the U-Bahn to Nicole, Looks like it takes some Time until the Git-Hub-IO Pages are updated.

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.08-00:36 on my Way to [Dettenhausen](40000013.md), I found out that external Links to Git-Hub-IO Pages should point to HTML- and not to Markdown-Pages.

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.08-00:42 on my Way to Dettenhausen, Try to add `/` to make the [File-Path](9000098.md) for Images absolute.

## Day-13: Dangerous Sub-Modules <a id="1300"/> 
###### Topics: Programming

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.06-14:09 in Tübingen, I continue working on the Concept of Git-Sub-Modules.

First I change the Name of my Fork-Repository on Git-Hub from `COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole` to `888`.

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.06-18:12 in Tübingen, After some Experiments I decided to rename the Clash-of-Clans Upstream-Repository into "0" and move it into a new [Git-Hub-Organization](9000079.md) called `All-Dings`.

Then I deleted the old `888-Repository`, replaced it by a new one and changed the [Language](600041.md) from [German](600005.md) to [English](600006.md).

Since all these Operations have been a little bit dangerous, I now also disabled [Git-Force-Push](9000080.md) on Git-Hub for both Repositories to protect myself from doing silly Things.

### Setup Git-Sub-Module

Now I setup a Git-Sub-Module in the `888-Repository` for the moved `0-Repository`:

```console
18:10 $ git submodule add git@github.com:All-Dings/0.git
Cloning into '/Users/michael-holzheu/All-Dings/888/0'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 2538, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (934/934), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (395/395), done.
remote: Total 2538 (delta 512), reused 847 (delta 459), pack-reused 1604
Receiving objects: 100% (2538/2538), 6.43 MiB | 6.66 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (1304/1304), done
```

This creates a new [Sub-Directory](9000083.md) in the `888-Repository` that we can see with the [Unix-Ls-Command](9000081.md):

```console
18:31 $ ls -l
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  351 michael-holzheu  staff  11232  6 Apr 18:31 0
-rw-r--r--    1 michael-holzheu  staff     27  6 Apr 18:08 README.md
```

With the [Git-Status-Command](9000082.md) we see that besides of the `0-Directory` also a hidden File Named `.gitmodules` has been created:

```console
18:35 $ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   .gitmodules
	new file:   0
```

The [Unix-Cat-Command](9000040.md) shows us the Content of this File:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [main|●2] 18:37
$ cat .gitmodules 
[submodule "0"]
	path = 0
	url = git@github.com:All-Dings/0.git
```

According to the very good [How-To](700022.md) [[0]](1150) for Git-Sub-Modules, I now check what Git tells us about our new Sub-Module with the [Git-Diff-Command](9000084.md):

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [main|●2] 18:52
$ git diff --cached  0
diff --git a/0 b/0
new file mode 160000
index 0000000..29783d2

+++ b/0
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+Subproject commit 29783d2cf991a95276404811054dcd640d77a733
```

We see that the Git-Commit `29783d2cf991a95276404811054dcd640d77a733` has been taken for the Sub-Module and with the `--submodule` Git-[Command-Option](9000085.md) we get all important Information about our new Sub-Module in one Summary:

```console
18:52 $ git diff --cached --submodule
diff --git a/.gitmodules b/.gitmodules
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..138b8ea
--- /dev/null

+       url = git@github.com:All-Dings/0.git
Submodule 0 0000000...29783d2 (new submodule
```

### Commit Git-Sub-Module

Now it is time to commit the Sub-Module to our `888-Repository` with the [Git-Commit](9000070.md)-Command using the `--all` and `--message` Options:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [main|●2] 19:13
$ git commit --all --message "Add 0-Repository"
[main cca43ac] Add 0-Repository
 2 files changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitmodules
 create mode 160000 0
```

This created a new Commit that added the `0-Repository` as a Git-Submodule:

```console
19:14 $ git show
commit cca43acc71067016525f423184b2f89c5d1a178b (HEAD -> main)

    Add 0-Repository

```

Finally I push the Commit to the remote `888-Repository` on Git-Hub:

```console
✘-128 ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 19:22
$ git push origin Master
Enumerating objects: 4, done.
Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.

Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 375 bytes | 375.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To github.com:All-Dings/888.git
   f5b7a07..cca43ac  Master -> Master
```
### Check Result

On Git-Hub this looks then like the Following:

![First Sub-Module](50000056.jpg)

To test what we have just created, we delete first our local Copy of the `888-Repository` ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings 19:35
$ rm -rf 888/
```

... and then use the [Git-Clone](9000086.md)-Command to get a fresh Copy from Git-Hub:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings 19:35
$ git clone git@github.com:All-Dings/888.git
Cloning into '888'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 9, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (9/9), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 9 (delta 0), reused 6 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (9/9), done.
```

With the Du-Unix-Command we see that the Size of the `888-Repository` with 128 Kilo-Byte is quite modest:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 
19:39 $ du -sh .
124K	.
```

This is because the Content of the `0-Repository` Sub-Module is not yet on our Disk-Drive:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 
19:39 $ ls 0/
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔]
```

For getting the Content of `0-Repository` we use the [Git-Sub-Module](9000087.md)-Init-Command, ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 
19:41 $ git submodule init
Submodule '0' (git@github.com:All-Dings/0.git) registered for path '0'
```

... followed by the Git-Sub-Module-Update-Command:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 
19:45 $ git submodule update
Cloning into '/Users/michael-holzheu/All-Dings/888/0'...
Submodule path '0': checked out '29783d2cf991a95276404811054dcd640d77a733
```

Now our Project consumes much more Space ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 
19:48 $ du -sh .
 13M	.
```

... and we can use the [Unix-Find-Command](9000088.md) to see our beloved Things form the `0-Repository` again:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 
19:54 $ find 0 | sort -V | head -7
0
0/.git
0/.gitattributes
0/.gitignore
0/0.md
0/1.md
0/2.md
```

### Add Reference

Now it is time to add the first [Reference](60039.md) `Michael` from our `888-Repository` to the `0-Repository` Sub-Module ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master|✔] 20:11
$ printf "\nOn Monday, April-2023-03 Nicole and [Michael](0/0.md) visited the town of Metzingen to shop for some nice new Clothes." >> README.md
```

... and then commit and push the Result:

```
✔ ~/All-Dings/888 [Master ↓·1|✚ 1] 
20:14 $ git commit -m "Add first Reference to 0-Repository" && git push
[Master 348b73d] Add first Reference to 0-Repository

remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.
To github.com:All-Dings/888.git
```

### Test

Finally I click on the Git-Hub [Web-Site](9000089.md) on the new Reference `0/0.md` with the Name `Michael`, and real [Computer-Networking](9200000.md)-Experts of course already know what will happen:

![404 Http-Error](50000057.jpg)

But according to the German [Saying](200100001.md): Immer langsam mit den jungen Pferden!

### Fix Tracking-Repository

I have asked a Friend to regularly pull from my `Clash-of-Clans` Repository and Today he sends me an E-Mail that after my Move to `All-Dings` he gets the Error `Repository not found`.

Then he sends me the compressed [Archive-File](9000093.md) of his latest local Snaphot:

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings 02:01
$ ls -lh Clash-of-Clans.tgz
-rw-r--r--@ 1 michael-holzheu  staff   9,9M  7 Apr 01:26 Clash-of-Clans.tgz
```

I use the [Unix-Tar-Command](9000092.md) to uncompress and unpack the Archive:

```console
✘-1 ~/All-Dings 02:07
$ tar xf Clash-of-Clans.tgz && cd Clash-of-Clans
```

Then I look for the last Commit that obviously is over two Days old: 

```
commit 74bc0c400e5a9848d7f01d11a3af7ae279d898dc
Author: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
Date:   Tue Apr 4 18:24:50 2023 +0200

    Add Strategy
```

It is clear that my Friend's last [Git-Pull-Command](9000094.md) failed, because his [Git-Remote](9000065.md) points to the old [URL](9000066.md):

```console
✘-HUP ~/All-Dings/Clash-of-Clans [Master|✔] 02:08
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git (push)
```

To fix that Problem we can use the [Git-Remote-Command](9000095.md) to set the new URL:

```console
✘-HUP ~/All-Dings/Clash-of-Clans [Master|✔] 02:16
$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:All-Dings/0.git
✔ ~/All-Dings/Clash-of-Clans [Master|✔]
```

Now the Git-Pull-Command works again ...

```console
✔ ~/All-Dings/Clash-of-Clans [Master|✔] 02:22
$ git pull

... and we see our latest Commit from some Minutes ago:

## Day-12: Two Universesy <a id="1200"/> 
###### Topics: Programming

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.05-15:42 in Tübingen, Today I would like to work again on a Concept for storing [Media-Files](30000000.md) efficiently in the Project:

My current Idea is to use [Git-Sub-Modules](9000063.md) for this Purpose.

### Create Git-Fork

For makeing some Tests I first create a [Git-Fork](9000064.md) of the original Ropository. First I create a Copy of the Repository:

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans$ cd ..
~$ cp -r Clash-of-Clans/ Clash-of-Clans-Fork
~$ cd Clash-of-Clans-Fork/
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$
```

I remove the [Git-Remote](9000065.md) "origin" from the Project:

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git (push)
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$ git remote remove origin
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$ git remote -v
```

I create on Git-Hub an empty new Repository with the Name "Clash-of-Clans-Fork" and then add its [URL](9000066.md) as Git-Remote to the Repository:

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$ git remote add Origin git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$ git remote -v
Origin	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git (fetch)
Origin	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git (push)
```

Then I use Git-Push to upload the Data to Git-Hub:

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$ git push --set-upstream Origin Master
Enumerating objects: 2249, done.), 604 KB | 0 B/s

```

Because I want to use the Photos of Nicole in Metzingen for the first Sub-Module, I rename the Repository to ...

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans-Fork$ cd ..
~$ mv Clash-of-Clans-Fork COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole
```

Then I add my Upsteam Git-Repository as a new Git-Remote:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git remote add Upstream git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git 
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git remote -v
Origin	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git (fetch)
Origin	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git (push)
Upstream	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git (fetch)
Upstream	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git (push)
```

Because I have committed already several Things to the [Upstream-Repository](404.md) the [Fork-Repository](404.md) is a little bit behind in History:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git log | head -11

    Add Git-Fork
```

We see that the last common Commit is the one with the [Hash-Value]() "97359863a670ffb1cb4aaaefe21fb4a90476368a". Therefore first I synchronize the backlevel COC-Metzingen-With-Nicole with the [Git-Fetch-Command](404.md):

```
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git fetch Upstream
remote: Enumerating objects: 33, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (33/33), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (29/29), done.
remote: Total 30 (delta 18), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (30/30), 7.72 KiB | 395.00 KiB/s, done.
From github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans
 * [new branch]      Master     -> Upstream/Master
```

Now all Information about the Upstream-Repository has been downloaded into the Fork-Repository. Next I use the [Git-Rebase-Command] to integrate the latest Changes from the Upstream-Repository's "Master" [Git-Branch](404.md) into my Fork-Repository "Master" Git-Branch:

```
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git rebase Upstream/Master
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/Master.
```

With the [Git-Log-Command](404.md) I now can see that ...

```
commit 939bd9c557542db053c9f9f5b014d46f2e41e8fc (HEAD -> Master, Upstream/Master)

Date:   Wed Apr 5 18:01:21 2023 +0200

    Compare Git-Remotes
```

... the Upstream Repository has been modified in the Meantime again:

```
commit 939bd9c557542db053c9f9f5b014d46f2e41e8fc (HEAD -> Master, origin/Master, origin/HEAD)

Date:   Wed Apr 5 18:01:21 2023 +0200

    Compare Git-Remotes
```

Now the [Git-Heads](404.md) of both Repositories are at the same [Git-Commit](404.md) "939bd9c557542db053c9f9f5b014d46f2e41e8fc":

```
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git show

Date:   Wed Apr 5 18:06:24 2023 +0200

    Fetch from Upstream-Repository
```

Let's draw a short [Diagram](700021.md) to illustrate the current State:


```
|
+----- Add Diagram ba7f76bc3400deb31c390ae7a9b635c0db817264 (HEAD -> Master, origin/Master, origin/HEAD)

|
+----- Compare Git-Remotes
|

```

Now let's create a Directory and a [Landing-Page](700020.md) in the Fork-Repository. For this Sub-Project I use the Number 888:

```
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ mkdir 888

```

Then I create a [Landing-Page](700020.md) File with the Name "888.md":

```
# Metzingen with Nicole

I meet Nicole on 2003-04-02 in Metzingen to buy some new Cloths and make some Test-Photos for the "Clash-of-Clans" Project.
```

Because Metzingen is not yet defined in the Upstream-Repository, I create a new Thing with Number 140000010.md in my Fork-Repository.

To make Life a bit easier for me, I switch for a Moment I switch now completely to the Fork-Repository "COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole" ...

In my Terminal-Session I now go to my Directory "COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole" and fetch the current State from the Upstream-Repository:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git fetch Upstream
remote: Enumerating objects: 43, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (43/43), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (37/37), done.
remote: Total 39 (delta 24), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (39/39), 9.35 KiB | 398.00 KiB/s, done.
From github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans
   939bd9c..0f82393  Master     -> Upstream/Master
```

Then I rebase my local Fork-Repository to get all the Updates:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git rebase Upstream/Master
```

With the Git-Log Command I look at the current [Blog-Chain](300000000.md):

```console

commit 0f82393eb01a1122cb3a062e43a4a616c3282ec5 (Upstream/Master)
Author: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
Date:   Wed Apr 5 19:51:42 2023 +0200

    Switch to Fork Metzingen-with-Nicole

```

Let's draw a new Diagram for the current State, where we realize that now the Fork-Repository is 4 Commits ahead of the Upstream-Repository:

```
+----- Add Metzingen (cd822cc8a33aea5054e2e1ab5852bf3b5c2d7d44 -> Fork-Repository)
|
+----- Add Metzingen
|
+----- Add Metzingen-with-Nicole
|
+----- Add Hash-Value
|
+----- Switch to Fork Metzingen-with-Nicole (0f82393eb01a1122cb3a062e43a4a616c3282ec5 -> Upstream-Repository)
|
```

To be not confused, I first rename the Git-Remote for my Fork properly:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git remote rename Origin Fork
Renaming remote references: 100% (1/1), done.
```

IMHO, now it's much more clear:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git remote -v
Fork	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git (fetch)
Fork	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans-Fork.git (push)
Upstream	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git (fetch)
Upstream	git@github.com:michael-holzheu/Clash-of-Clans.git (push)
```

### Synchronize with Upstream-Repository 

Now let's try to move the new Stuff to the Upstream-Repository. This can be done by a [Git-Pull-Request](404.md).

For doing that we first need to create a new [Git-Branch](e9000069.md) from the last common [Git-Commit](9000070.md) that we already identified by its Hash-Value 0f82393eb01a1122cb3a062e43a4a616c3282ec5:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git branch PR-0-First-Sync 0f82393eb01a1122cb3a062e43a4a616c3282ec5
```

In our Diagram this then looks like the Following:

```
+----- Add Metzingen (cd822cc8a33aea5054e2e1ab5852bf3b5c2d7d44 -> Fork-Repository)
|
+----- Add Metzingen
|
+----- Add Metzingen-with-Nicole
|
+----- Add Hash-Value
|
+----- Switch to Fork Metzingen-with-Nicole (0f82393eb01a1122cb3a062e43a4a616c3282ec5 -> PR-0-First-Sync)
|
```

Now lets do a [Git-Checkout](9000071.md) of our new Git-Branch:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git checkout PR-0-First-Sync
Switched to branch 'PR-0-First-Sync'
```

Then let's check the Commits on this Branch:

```console
commit 0f82393eb01a1122cb3a062e43a4a616c3282ec5 (HEAD -> PR-0-First-Sync, Upstream/Master)
Author: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
Date:   Wed Apr 5 19:51:42 2023 +0200

    Switch to Fork Metzingen-with-Nicole

commit fbb3a86eacce71dc061f93913627a04a3f868078
Author: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
Date:   Wed Apr 5 19:49:01 2023 +0200

    Update
```

As expected that last Commit is our known [Fork-Point](404.md):

```console
commit 0f82393eb01a1122cb3a062e43a4a616c3282ec5 (HEAD -> PR-0-First-Sync, Upstream/Master)
Author: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
Date:   Wed Apr 5 19:51:42 2023 +0200

    Switch to Fork Metzingen-with-Nicole

commit fbb3a86eacce71dc061f93913627a04a3f868078
Author: Michael Holzheu <michael@holzheu.de>
Date:   Wed Apr 5 19:49:01 2023 +0200

    Update
```

To get the new Commits of the Master Git-Branch into our new Branch we use the Git-Rebase Command:

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ git rebase Master

```

We now can see our last Work on the PR-0 Branch:

```console
commit 9f6f8056445caeef70d58c4b3daf58a9b84148a3 (HEAD -> PR-0-First-Sync, Fork/Master, Master)

    Add Reference
```

In order to see the Git-Branch on the [Bash-Prompt](9000072.md) I install ...

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ brew install bash-git-prompt
Running `brew update --auto-update`...
```

... and then add the following Lines to my [Bash-RC-File](9000073.md):

```console
if [ -f "$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/bash-git-prompt/share/gitprompt.sh" ]; then
     __GIT_PROMPT_DIR="$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/bash-git-prompt/share"
     source "$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/bash-git-prompt/share/gitprompt.sh"
fi
```

Then I enable the new Function with the [Bash-Source-Command](9000074.md) and now we can see the currenty active Branch and the Time in the Prompt: 

```console
~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole$ source ~/.bashrc
✔ ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [Master|✔] 
00:21 $
```

Now let's go again to the Pull-Request Branch ...

```console
00:29 $ git checkout PR-0-First-Sync
Switched to branch 'PR-0-First-Sync'
✔ ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [PR-0-First-Sync L|✔] 
00:29 $ 
```

... and get the latest Commits from the Master-Branch:

```console
00:30 $ git rebase Master
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/PR-0-First-Sync.
✔ ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [PR-0-First-Sync L|✔] 
```


Now let's Use the Git-Push-Command to publish the Branch on the Fork Remote:


```console
00:42 $ git push --all -u --set-upstream git@github.com:michael-holzheu/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole.git

branch 'PR-0-First-Sync' set up to track 'git@github.com:michael-holzheu/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole.git/PR-0-First-Sync'.

```

To create the Pull-Request, we first install the Hub-Extension:


```console
✔ ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [PR-0-First-Sync L|✔] 
00:47 $ brew install hub
```

First we have to configure ...

```
✘-1 ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [PR-0-First-Sync L|✔] 
01:22 $ cat ~/.config/hub
---
github.com:

```

Frist set the Master Branch back to the common Commit:


```console
✘-1 ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [PR-0-First-Sync L|✔] 
01:25 $ git checkout Master
Switched to branch 'Master'
✔ ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [Master L|✔]

01:26 $ git branch -l

```

Switch to the Pull-Request Branch again:


```console
01:26 $ git checkout PR-0-First-Sync
Switched to branch 'PR-0-First-Sync'
✔ ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [PR-0-First-Sync L|✔] 
```

Then finally create the Pull-Request:


```console
01:36 $ hub pull-request -b Master 
https://github.com/michael-holzheu/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole/pull/1
✔ ~/COC-Metzingen-with-Nicole [PR-0-First-Sync L|✔]

Real Git-Experts of course know, that this did the wrong Thing, so I make it simple for Today and setup the Upstream-Branch properly ...

```console

... and finally push all the new Things to my Upstream-Repository:

## Day-10: The Beauty <a id="1000"/> 

### Simple Work

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.03-08:50 in Tübingen, I started to cleanup some Things:

```console
michael-holzheu@MacBook/Clash-of-Clans $ grep "Cat-Com" *.md
23.md:Before looking into that one, we copy the new [Code](9000039.md) into a separate File [Du-Script](9000038.bash) and check its [Content](600021.md) with the [Cat-Command](9000040.md):
9000040.md:# Cat-Command
9000040.md:The Cat-Command 
```

Though manually renaming Stuff means a lot of [Work](60036.md), for Wakeup in the Morning it has its [Beauty](60035.md) and somehow feels more like [Fun](60037.md).

After my simple [Work-Item](120000001.md) the [Indentation-Levels](700016.md) of all [Lines](700011.md) are fixed. 

### German Wireless-Problems

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.03-10:20 on my Way to Nicole, I continue to finish the Simple Work ...

Because the [Wireless-LAN](9000060.md) most of the Times does not work in German's [Auto-Buses](20000004.md), I switch to the [Git-Hub](9000061.md) online [User-Interface](9000062.md).

## Day-9: An Original <a id="900"/>
###### Topics: Programming

### Sorted-Things

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.02-14:45 in Tübingen, I already created many Numbers for this Project and in order to not lose track of the Situation, I created a [List](60008.md) where the Things are [ordered](60010.md) more or less according their [Number](60000.md):

```console
$ head -n 4 Almost-Sorted-Things.txt 
30010003.md Pixel
30010002.md Full-HD
30010001.md Resolution
30010000.md Media-Formats
```

First I want to sort the List in the reverse Order:

```console
$ cat Almost-Sorted-Things.txt | sort -nr > Sorted-Things.txt
```

Next I would like to create a Markdown-Document with [Links](9000046.md) that is clickable:

```
$ cat Sorted-Things.txt | (while read Number Name; do printf "%-14s %-20s [Link](%s)\n" $Number $Name $Number; done) > SortedThingsWithMarkDown.md
```

Looks almost good, but some Things still have to be fixed manually, for Example:

```
12000000.md    Expert               [Link](12000000.md)
11091971.md    Michael's            [Link](Calendar)
11091971.md                         [Link]()              <====
11000000.md    History              [Link](11000000.md)
```

Afterwards I append the Result to the [README](README.md) File using the [MV-Command](9000046):

```console
$ cat README.md SortedThingsWithMarkDown.md > tmp.md
$ mv tmp.md README.md
```

To make the Links clickable, originally I have added all the Things into a Markdown-List:

```
- 1000000099.md  NinetyNine           [Link](1000000099.md)

- 30010003.md    Pixel                [Link](30010003.md)
- 30010002.md    Full-HD              [Link](30010002.md)
```

But somehow I don't like the [Layout](700017.md). For removing the Links again, I use the following VIM-Command:

```
:%s/\s\+\[Link.*//g
```

Now it looks like the Following:

```
- 1000000099.md  NinetyNine

- 30010003.md    Pixel
- 30010002.md    Full-HD
- 30010001.md    Resolution
```

To replace the leading Bullets, I enter the VIM-Visual-Mode with the Control-v [Keyboard-Shortcut](9000048.md), then remove the leading Bullets and finally I mark the whole Section with "```" as a [Markdown-Code-Block](40003101.md):

```
1000000099.md  NinetyNine

30010003.md    Pixel
30010002.md    Full-HD
30010001.md    Resolution
```

### Big Things (again)

Now I come back to my old Question, how to store big Files in this Project. After I having rejected the idea of using LFS, now another Idea came to my Mind.

What about storing the [Big-Data](9000049.md) seperate from the Not-So-Big-Data?

### Sample Image

I plan to test the new Concept with a Picture-for-Nicole:

![](55.jpg)

According my current Rules I stored it in Full-HD Resolution in my Clash-of-Clans [GIT-Repository](9000050.md), where all the Files together currently have the Size of about 4 Megabytes:

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans$ bash 9000038.bash | tail -n 2
README.md            3967 4121912
./2000002.md           34 4121879
```

The Byte-Size of our Picture in [JPG-Image-Format](30010004.md) is ...

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans$ ls -l 55.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  905873  2 Apr 19:08 55.jpg
```

If we divide the Size of 905.873 [Bytes](9000013.md) by 1024 we get around 900 [Kilo-Bytes](9000014.md).

Then I use the [Image-Editing](9000054.md) [Application](9000055.md) [Gimp](9000053.md) for converting the [Image](30000002.md) from compressed JPG-Image-Format into [RAW-Image-Format](30010005.md) and check its Byte-Size:

```console
~$ ls -l 55.raw 
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  29942784  2 Apr 21:08 55.raw
```

So now the same Picture in that [Format](60019.md) uses 29.942.784 Bytes or around 30 Mega-Bytes of my Disk-Drive.

### Compression

The Reason for the 29 Mega-Bytes Difference between JPG and RAW is [Compression](9000051.md): The JPG-Image-Format is highly compressed and still provides enough [Information](60007.md) for [Rendering](9000052.md) the Picture in a way that a [Human](40000001.md) can understand its [Meaning](60002.md).

The higher we make the [Compression-Level](9000057.md), the lower is the [File-Size](9000056.md):

```console
michael-holzheu@MacBook/55 $ ls -lS
total 72528
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  29942784  2 Apr 21:08 55.raw
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff   2382877  2 Apr 21:56 55-100.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff   2382877  2 Apr 21:56 55-80.jpg
-rw-r--r--@ 1 michael-holzheu  staff    905873  2 Apr 21:59 55-94.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    905873  2 Apr 21:56 55.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    243910  2 Apr 21:57 55-60.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    181193  2 Apr 21:57 55-40.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    118690  2 Apr 21:57 55-20.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff     50984  2 Apr 21:57 55-00.jpg
```

But the lower the Compression-Level, the lower is also the [Quality](60020.md):

![JPG-Compression Level 0](50000055.jpg)

### About Quality

Hmm, I somehow like the highly-compressed [Image](30000002.md), so probably we have to specify the Meaning of Quality a bit more.

For Example, when we get into the [Territory](600036.md) of [Fine-Arts](60000000.md), it is not so easy to measure the [Quantity](60021.md) of a [Picture](60000001.md).

In the [Context](600034.md) of [Photography](50000000.md) at first Glance it seems much simpler, because a [Photo](50000001.md) should come close to [Reality](40000.md). So in this Respect the higher compressed Image has less Quality.

And the highest Quality regarding Reality should have the [Orignal](60022.md), no?

### The Original

In Photography the "best" [Image-Format](30010006.md) regarding Quality is probably the uncompressed RAW-Image-Format, but for our Example this is a bit more complicated.

The Reason is that current [Smart-Phones](20000005.md) normally store the Photos already in JPG-Image-Format and this is also the case for our [Picture-for-Nicole](55.jpg).

When I convert the compressed Image back to RAW-Image-Format, we probably even loose Qualtiy because during the [Conversion](600037.md) Image-Information will be lost.

If we assume that by [Definition](13000002.md) the Original is the Image with the best Quality, by [Logic](600038.md) we can come to the [Conclusion](600027.md) that our the JPG-Image is original.

But wait ...

According to my [Rules](5.md) I already resized the Image to Full-HD Format, therefore the File in this Repository is *not* the Original.

So let's copy the "Original" into our Directory:

```console
michael-holzheu@MacBook/55 $ ls -lS
total 75288
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  29942784  2 Apr 21:08 55.raw
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff   2382877  2 Apr 21:56 55-100.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff   2382877  2 Apr 21:56 55-80.jpg
-rw-r--r--@ 1 michael-holzheu  staff   1409592  2 Apr 19:04 original_60bf61ca-6207-4ed8-a563-17186415691b_20230401_141946.jpg
-rw-r--r--@ 1 michael-holzheu  staff    905873  2 Apr 21:59 55-94.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    905873  2 Apr 21:56 55.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    243910  2 Apr 21:57 55-60.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    181193  2 Apr 21:57 55-40.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff    118690  2 Apr 21:57 55-20.jpg
-rw-r--r--@ 1 michael-holzheu  staff     50984  2 Apr 21:57 55-00.jpg
```

With its 1,4 Megabytes in Terms of File-Size it lies beetween the two Full-HD Images with 80% and 94% Compression.

This sounds good at first glance, but now let's use the [Exif-Tool](9000059.md) to check the [Image-Size](30010007.md):

```console
michael-holzheu@MacBook/55 $ exiftool original_60bf61ca-6207-4ed8-a563-17186415691b_20230401_141946.jpg | grep "Image Size"
Image Size                      : 3648x2736
```

This means that we have a [Resolution](30010001.md) of 3648 Pixels for the [Width](10000005.md) and 2736 for the [Height](10000006.md).

So according to [Adam-Ries](70000001.md) who is a famous [Personality](70000000.md) in the [Discipline](7000003.md) of [Mathematics](13000000.md), we have in total ...

```console
~/Clash-of-Clans$ echo "... $((3648 * 2736)) Pixels."
... 9980928 Pixels.
```

Taking into account the File-Size of 1409592 Bytes, this means that one Pixel requires ...

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ echo "... $((1409592 / 9980928)) Bytes."
... 0 Bytes.
```

Obviously [Arithmethic](13000005.md) with more Quality is required here and we better use good-old [Floating-Point](13000004.md) to get some [Precision](10000007.md) into the [Calculation](13000003.md).

So let's switch from [Bash](34.md) to a [Computer-Language](9010000.md) with a little bit more [Functions](600039.md), namely ...

```
michael-holzheu@MacBook/55 $ perl -E "say 1409592 / 9980928"  
0.141228551092644
```

As a [Mathematician](80000002.md) this [Result](60033.md) reminds me to a [Famous-Number](13010000.md) but this is really pure [Coincidence](99.md).

Perhaps, perhaps not...

Wouldn't be [Life](404.md) without any [Secrets](https://www.holzheu.de/rumaenien-2018-teil-3#69mp3) a litte [Bit](75.md) too boring? Keep your courious and sleep well!

## Day-8: Big Data <a id="800"/>
###### Topics: Git, Lfs

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-15:15 in Tübingen, After I finished Tennis Training, good Lunch and Shopping, now it's Time to find a good Solution for storing Big Data, like Music, Pictures, and Movies.

Up to now my favourite Solution was Git's [Large Files Support](15.md#Large-File-Support), but I already made some [unpleasant](666.md) Experiences with that [Software](9000006.md).

Although I already [configured](15.gitconfig) the Stuff, it is no longer working. For some [Reason](600030.md) the [Files](9000007.md) are still uploaded directly into the "normal" Git Repository.

The most [likely](600031.md) Reason is that I deleted and cloned the [Repository](9000010.md) many Times and therefore Parts of the [Configuration](9000011.md) have been lost.

### Experiments

In Order not to mess up my Clash-of-Clans I first create a new Repository to play with. But before doing that, I first want to store an [Image](30000002.md) in the "normal" Clash-of-Clans.

#### Commit Screenshot to Git

It is a [Screenshot](30000001.md) in [Full-HD](30010002.md) that has the Size of 170777 Bytes or equivalent to 167 Kilobytes:

```console
$ ls -l 88.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff  170777  1 Apr 16:37 88.jpg
$ ls -lh 88.jpg 
-rw-r--r--  1 michael-holzheu  staff   167K  1 Apr 16:37 88.jpg
```
##### Repository Data-Size

But before [committing]() the File, first check the old [Data-Size](9000016.md) of the Repository, which is 19120 [Bytes](9000013.md) or equivalent (more or less) to 9,3 [Mega-Bytes](9000015.md):

```console
$ du -s Clash-of-Clans 
19120	Clash-of-Clans
$ du -hs Clash-of-Clans
9,3M	Clash-of-Clans
```

As every [Expert](12000000.md) in [Informatics](9000000.md) knows, a [Disk-Drive](20000002.md) stores [Data](60001.md) in [Blocks](9000018.md) and the Usage of the [Device](20000000.md) is therefore also shown in that [Unit](10000003.md).

So to calculate the Usage in Bytes we first have to find out the [Block-Size](9000017.md):

```
$ diskutil info / | grep "Block Size"
   Device Block Size:         4096 Bytes
   Allocation Block Size:     4096 Bytes

$ $ stat -f %k .
4096
```

This means that one Block on [My-Mac-Book](2000002.md) has 4096 Bytes and therefore the Disk-Drive-Usage can be calculated with ...

```
$ echo "$((4096 * 19120))"
78315520
```

For [Verification]() we calculate the Size in Mega-Bytes with ...

```
$ echo "$((1000 * 1000))"
1000000

$ echo "$((78315520 / 1000000))"
78
```

Oehm, as we saw at the beginning the "du -sh" Command told us that the "Clash of Clans" [Directory](9000019.md) uses 9,3 Mega-Bytes of Disk [Storage](9000020.md). The Question is, how does that match to the 78 Mega-Bytes, we calculated by the Blocksize and the "du -s" Command?

Let's find first out the [Sum](3000001.md) of the [Byte-Sizes](9000021.md) of all [Files](9000007.md) in the Directory:

```

```

That's a lot of files ...

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ ls | wc -w
     165
```

Let's write a "short" [Script](9000023.md) that forms a [Sum](13000001.md) over all the File-Sizes:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ ls -l | tail -n +2 | (while read -r Line; do FileSize=$(echo $Line | awk '{print $5}'); FileName=$(echo $Line | awk '{print $9}'); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done)
0.md                  442   442
1.md                  228   670
100.md                130   800
10000.jpg           43265 44065
...
9000019.md             32 3194690
9000020.md             26 3194716
904.md                120 3194836
README.md             256 3195092
```

I realize that the Sum over all File-Sizes is 3195092 Bytes, or written different as 3.195.092 Bytes, respective around 3.195 Kilo-Bytes or 3 Mega-Bytes.

We saw above that the [DU-Command](9000028.md) with the [Command-Options](9000029.md) "-hs" tells me that the [Disk-Usage](9000027.md) is 9,3 Mega-Bytes, so where are the missing 6 Mega-Bytes?

Of course every good [Computer](20000003.md) Expert knows that most [Operating-Systems](9000030.md) provide [File-Systems](9000025.md), that provide [Hidden-Files](9000026.md).

Traditionally under [Unix](9000031.md) hidden Files begin with a Dot and with the so-called [Find-Command](9000032.md) we can show behind the Scenes and already the first Line of [Output](60017.md) shows the hidden [Pointer](9000033.md) "." to the current [Work-Directory](9000034.md).

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ find .
.
./50003.md
./100.md
```

Looking further down, we see the first "real" Hidden-File, namely ...

```
./20.md
./30.md
./.gitignore
```

BTW, the Data in the [Git-Ignore-File](58.md#git-ignore-file) defines all Files that should be ingored by the Git-Command.

But before we come back on that, let's rewrite our original Skript a bit and use the [Grep-Command](9000036.md), the [Stat-Command](9000037.md) plus some [Regular-Expressions](9000035.md) for the Calculation of the Disk-Usage:

```
$ find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done)
./50003.md            139   139
./9000025.md           36   175

...

./2.md                333 3198498
./2000002.md           34 3198532
```

Hmm, now we get 3198510 Bytes and the old Script calculated 3195092 Bytes, if I remember correctly, so thats ...

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$  echo "$((3195092 - 3198532)) Bytes less."
-3440 Bytes less.
```

Of course every real [Nerd](12000001.md) who thinks he's something in the Computing Area, knows of course that we created a lot of Files since we ran the old Script the last Time.

Before looking into that one, we copy the new [Code](9000039.md) into a separate File [Du-Script](9000038.bash) and check its [Content](600021.md) with the [CAT-Command](9000040.md):

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ cat 9000038.bash
# Du-Script

find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done)
```

As first [Test-Case](9000042.md) of the Script I run it with [Bash-](34.md) and the [TAIL-Command](9000041.md):

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ bash 9000038.bash | tail -n 2
./2.md                333 3198802
./2000002.md           34 3198836
```

Now let me run the Code again as [One-Liner](700012.md) and compare the Output:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done) | tail -n 2
./2.md                333 3198802
./2000002.md           34 3198836
```

Now I add the first One-Liner to my Du-Script and add the "tail -n 1" command to both Lines:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ cat 9000038.bash
# Du-Script

# First Script
ls -l | tail -n +2 | (while read -r Line; do FileSize=$(echo $Line | awk '{print $5}'); FileName=$(echo $Line | awk '{print $9}'); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done) | tail -n 1

# Second Script
find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done) | tail -n 1
```

So now when running the Script in [Theory](7000001.md) I would expect to see two Lines showing the same Result, so let's try it ...

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ bash 9000038.bash 
README.md             256 3201483
./2000002.md           34 3199246
```

To find out the [Reason](600030.md) for the [Problem](600029.md) some some [Debugging](9000044.md) is required. My first [Hypothis](600028.md) is that the second Script for why ever finds less Files that the first one.

And indeed, after I checked the List of [File-Types](9000045.md) and realized that three of them are missing, I add them to the second Script:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ git diff
diff --git a/9000038.bash b/9000038.bash
index 748352c..d175d9c 100644
--- a/9000038.bash
+++ b/9000038.bash
@@ -4,4 +4,4 @@

 # Second Script
-find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done) | tail -n 1
+find . -type file | grep -E './[a-zA-Z0-9]*\.(md|jpg|markdown|bash|bashrc|dockerfile|vimrc|gitconfig)' | (while read -r FileName; do FileSize=$(stat -f "%z" $FileName); SumSize=$((SumSize + FileSize)); printf "%-16s %8s %5s\n" $FileName $FileSize $SumSize; done) | tail -n 1
```

Now I am confident that both Scripts will show the same Result now:

```
~/Clash-of-Clans$ bash 9000038.bash
README.md             256 3201540
./2000002.md           34 3201510
```

Oh Boy, still not finished, let's look at our Files again:

```
$ git mv 700001 700001.md
$ git commit -m "Rename Document"
$ git push
```

## Day-7: Problems <a id="700"/>
###### Topics: GFR

### DB-Navigator Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-01:20, We looked up for a Train back to Tübigen and the DB-App shows me a possible Connection. Nice, so I can save the Money for the Taxi. After I waiting 20 Minutes on the Subway-Platform, I read the Timetable which then tells me that there are no more trains at this time.

So looks like this is a Problem with the [DB-Navigator](8009999.md).

### Samsung Pen Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-00:36, I show Nicole my Project and she suggests to use the Pen of my [Samsung-Galaxy-S22-Ultra](20000001.md) and test Handwriting. After 10 Minutes fighting with Problems we stopped the [Experiment](10010000.md).

### Electricity Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-22:18 on my Way to Nicole, This time I did not forget my Charging-Device for the MacBook and fortunately the [German-Federal-Raiload](8009999.md) provides [Electricity](10000001.md), Problem solved!

### Heil-und-Kostenplan Problem

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.31-13:OO in Tübingen, I read an E-Mail from the [Singing-Dentist](404.md), where he points out that I have forgotten to bring the [Heil-und-Kostenplan](8000999.md#Heil-und-Kostenplan) as I promised.
 
In fact I was Yesterday Evening at the Dental-Practice. Before putting the Document into the Post-Box, I skimmed it a very last time. Then I noticed a yellow Label:

```
* Achtung
Sehr geehrter Patient!
Bitte diesen Heil- und Kostenplan
1. zusammen mit dem Bunusheft bei Ihrer Krankenkasse einreichen
2. nach Zuschussfestsetzung durch die Kasse den Antrag bitte umgehend an die Praxis zurück
```

Unfortunately I only read up to Line Number 4, and then concluded that I have taken the wrong Document. So unfortunatley the Way was for Nothing.

Back home I search for the "right" Document which I - by logical [Conclusion](600027.md) - cannot find.

I felt rememinded to my recently [lost Work](#about-trust). So I developted the [Hypothesis](600028.md) that I might have already delivered the Document. But then I checked my [Calendar](11091971.md) found out the [Truth](600021.md):

For the first Appointment I brought the wrong Document and I promised to deliver the right one for the next (second) Session. If my [Memory](600032.md) does not deceive me, I see almost 100% [Probablity](600031.md) that something must have gone wrong.

Therefore I now also read the 5th [Line](50010.md) and detected the [Reason](600030.md) for my [Problem](600029.md).

After that [Realization](600033.md) I grabbed the Heil- und Kostenplan, walked agein to the Dentist and put the Document into his Post-Box.

## Day-6: More Concepts <a id="600"/>
###### Topics: Concepts

### Finished Work

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-23:25 still on my Way to Nicole, I finished the Work for Today, CU Tomorrow!

### About Apple Macbook Pro 14'' M1

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-23:17 still on my Way to Nicole, Not a good Time for the Project. Today, my MacBook seems to empty his Battery faster than expected ... 

### About Trust (again)

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-22:47 still on my Way to Nicole, Believe it or not my first Information Container Concepts have disappeared ...

### Information Containers

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-22:34 finally on my Way to Nicole, I start to add Concepts about Information Containers.

### About Trust

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-22:19 on my Way to Nicole, Believe it or not, but our Story about "Micha ... (again)" is lost somewhere in all this crazy mess.

### Add Theory

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-20:03 in Tübingen(TBD), Before starting the real work, I first want to summarize the [Theory](700001.md) into a List.

### Add History

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.30-13:27 in Tübingen(TBD), I decided to combine my first Days into this [Document](700001.md) for describing the [History](11000000.md) of this Project.

## Day-5: First Concepts <a id="500"/>
###### Topics: Concepts

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.29-17-25, I am on my Way to Nicole [[0]](#1101) and after the [Cleanup Work](100.md) Yesterday, now I would like to use the [Time](10000002.md) for adding some new [Concepts](600011.md).

### Footnotes

[<a name="1101"></a>0] Extra Tour with Nicole: [https://www.holzheu.de/extra-tour-with-nicole](https://www.holzheu.de/extra-tour-with-nicole)

## Day-4: Big "Cleanup" <a id="400"/> 

Blog-Chain-Time [2023.03.28-22:35](1100001.md) in [Tübingen](2000001.md), After Micha did the technical Work Yesterday, today our Creative Chief Officer [Michi](19.md) joined our Party to bring a bit more Pepper into the Souce.

But first I really want to beatify our [Work](99.md) a little bit.

So let's first check what we have written in the Document [[0]](#2100) with the meaningful Number [99](1000000099.md), where obviously Somebody forgot to add a [Footnote](50003.md) for this famous saying:

```
But Caution is the Mother of the Porcelain Box, so let's make some Experiments first.
```

Our current Favourite [Markdown Footnotes](50001.md) have the Drawback that the [Numbers]() have to be specified manually, and to put it strait:

```
This can sometimes really be really be "Pain in the Ass"!
```

But before we can come back to that, we have first to define some basic [Things]. Oh Man, perhaps I should not have started that, because after ten Minutes I already created a long List of very important new Things.

But before I could commit those, we first had to define other even more urgent [Things](), namely [Michi](19.md), the simple [Show Mouse](577.md) and my [Bunnie Page]().

And there was a small Problem to enable the [Broken Link]() page - not a big deal, I will do that together with Micha sometime later [1] .

But let's come back to the starting Point with the Footnotes. Obviously I had been a little bit too optimistic. Obviously on GitHub the modern fancy Features of the Markup Languate have not yet arrived. But this has time until Tomorrow.

So only one more Thing ...

## Day-3: A nasty Egg <a id="300"/> 
###### Topics: Bugs

Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.27-??:?? in Tübingen(TBD), Damn, I forgot to commit my [33.md](33.md) Baby. Normally this is no big Deal, but unfortunately the already committed [27.md](27.md) has a Reference to it:

```console
root:~ (devel)# head 27.md
# Echo Bug
Everytime when I execute the [mmls](33.md#mmls) command, a new file "echo" is created.
```

I am screwed when Someone checks out the Code now and sees the broken Link. So let's checkin the missing File quickly:

```console
root:~ (devel)# git add 33.md
root:~ (devel)# git commit -s -m "Add 33.md to fix the broken Link in 27.md in the previous commit"
[devel 5a30961] Add 33.md to fix the broken Link in 27.md in the previous commit
 1 file changed, 26 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 33.md
```

Puh, Nobody saw my Mistake and now we are save again:

```console
root:~ (devel)# git log --oneline | head -3
5a30961 Add 33.md to fix the broken Link in 27.md in the previous commit
c3c6df2 Add more Files to ignore
46aa317 Add Echo Bug
```

But wait, if some Grumpy gets to the crazy idea to check out "Echo Bug" Commit 46aa317, he can still find out my sloppiness. Oh Man, I really have laid myself a nasty egg:
