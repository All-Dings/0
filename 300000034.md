## Why should I pay?

## How much should I pay?

To get a [Feeling](60041.md) for the [Value](700030.md) you received from the [Dings-Project](300000006.md) try to compare it to something Physical, for Example ask yourself, how much [Brezels](203410001.md) was that worth?

For the [Conversion](600037.md) from [Brezel](203410001.md) to [Euro](130000004.md) you can use [My-Brezel-Index](302000003.md), that currently:
