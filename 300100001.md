# All-Dings-Overview <a id="0"/>

All-Dings-Overview is a [Presentation](404.md) that describes the [Goals](60058.md) of the [Dings-Project](300000006.md).

## Mission-Statement <a id="1000"/>

The [Dings-System](300000007.md) is a [Computer-System](9000153.md), that is able to host *all* of your Digital-Data as [Dings-Objects](300000001.md) with the Purpose of:

- Storing
- Backup
- Finding
- Analysis
- Reporting
- Versioning
- Presenting

## Basics <a id="2000"/>

### Objects <a id="2010"/>

There are [Dings-Objects](300000001.md) that are purly digital, as for Example this Document, but there are also Objects that have a Connection to Reality, for Example:

- [Michael_Holzheu](0.md)
- [Muffi](1971091151.md)
- [My-Pocket-Calculator](1971091108.md)

### Numbers <a id="2020"/>

All [Dings-Objects](300000001.md) have an unique [Dings-Number](300000015.md) that will be for Eternity. The Numbers can be used for internal [References](60039.md) and as [Address](611002.md) for the Internet or Intranet:

- Example: [https://dings.site/0.html](0.md)

### Names <a id="2030"/>

Each Dings-Object has a Dings-Name, that can be changed. [References](60039.md) to the Object can use different Names, for Example:

- Besides of Programming [Mike](0.md), is also able to play Tennis.

### References <a id="2040"/>

As just seen, Dings-Objects can reference each other, which adds new Information for both Objects, for Example with every [Reference](60039.md) the System automatically learns alternative [Names](60048.md) for Dings-Objects in different Contexts:

```
$ dings list 0
0 "Michael-Georg_Holzheu"
  - Mike [All-Dings-Overview](300100001)
```

The more Documents reference Objects, the more Information is added to the System and Humans or AI are able to find this very easily:

```
$ dings list 1971091151
1971091151 "Muffi"
  - Muffi [All-Dings-Overview](300100001)
  - Muffi [About](21)
  - Muffi [Muffi-and-Schnuffi-Photo](400000001)
```

### Definitions <a id="2050"/>

Each Dings-Object has a short [Definition](13000002.md) that should make clear, what exactly is meant, for Example:

- Michael-Georg_Holzheu is a [Human](40000001.md).

### Embedding <a id="2060"/>

Besides of referencing Dings-Objects, they can also be embedded in other Objects, for Example [My-Calculator-Photo](400000105.md) can be also included in this Document:

![Embedded Version](400000105.jpg)

### Apps <a id="2070"/>

Besides embedding simple Objects like Images or Sound, it is also possible to include [Dings-Apps](300000020.md) in Documents:

![The-Don't-Waste-App](400000050.quiz)

## Presenting <a id="3000"/>

The Dings-Objects are presented via [Html-Files](9000134.md), that can be shown in each [Browser](9000128.md).

There are three security Levels:

- Local
- Intranet (currently with Password
- Internet

## Use-Cases <a id="4000"/>

### Medicine <a id="4010"/>

- [My-Fellow-Occupant-Medical-History](1000010002.md)

### Patents <a id="4020"/>

- [Zero-Wave-Device-Patent](300050001.md)

### Blogs <a id="4030"/>

- [About Michael](21.md)

### Science <a id="4040"/>

- [My-Doctorial-Thesis](333333333.md)
- [Pythagorean-Comma](23.md#10100)

### Education <a id="4041"/>

- [Over-Tone-App](23.md#10500)

### Accounting <a id="4050"/>

When Bills are stored in the Dings-System half-automatically the correct References are created. For Example, if the Dings-System already knows the Car-Insurance-Number, the Reference to the Contract can be make by automatically using OCR.
The Car-Insurance already has a Reference to the Car.

Therefore the User could ask the System for Example:

- How much did I pay for my Insurance the last Year?
- How much did I pay in total for may Car in the last three Years?

### Advertising <a id="4060"/>

If a Dings-User reads [My-Good-Meal-Blog](21.md#3300) and then goes to the Delhi-Palace, he could add a Comment that he likes or does not like the Chilli-Chicken.
In any Case the Delhi-Palace should give a Reward to the Blog-Writer. In Case the User likes the Food, the Writer of the Blog should also get
a Reward from the Dings-User.
