# All-Dings-Overview <a id="0"/>

All-Dings-Overview is a [Presentation](700062.md), that describes the [Goals](60058.md) and [Concepts](600011.md) of the [Dings-Project](300000006.md).

## Problem <a id="6000"/>

Current [Computer-Systems](9000153.md) have lot's of Problems:

- Different Systems, User-Interfaces, Versions ...
- Bad Interfaces between Systems
- Data not well connected
- Systems for Humans vs. Systems for Machines
- No Control over own Data
- Unidentified and anonymous Users
- Chaos

## Mission <a id="1000"/>

The [Dings-System](300000007.md) is an "egg-laying, milk-bearing woolly" [Computer-System](9000153.md), that is able to host *all* of your [Data](60001.md) as [Dings-Objects](300000001.md), that can be used for both, [Humans](40000001.md) and [Computers](9000153.md). For transfering the current [Chaos](60183.md) in the into [Order](60010.md) again, it combines all Features of the currently not well linked Systems:

- Storing
    - [File-Systems](9000025.md)
    - [Databases](2000245.md)
- Versioning
    - [Github](9000061.md)
- Backup
- Information Organization
    - [Wikipedia](190000006.md)
    - [Wikidata](191000001.md)
- Search & Find
    - Google-Search
- Analysis
    - [ChatGPT](9000150.md)
- Reporting / Accounting
    - SAP
- Processing
    - [Gimp](9000053.md)
    - Microsoft-Word
    - Microsoft-Excel
    - Premiere-Pro
- Digital-Money
    - [Bitcoin](130000023.md)
    - [Ethereum](130000042.md)
- Smart-Contracts
    - [Ethereum](130000042.md)
- Communication
    - [E-Mail](9000139.md)
    - [WhatsApp](9000139.md)
    - [Social-Media](241000000.md): [Facebook](240000017.md), [LinkedIn](241000001.md), [Twitter](190000008.md), etc.
- Presenting
    - [Wordpress](404.md)
    - [YouTube](190000001.md)
    - [Social-Media](241000000.md): [Facebook](240000017.md), [LinkedIn](241000001.md), [Twitter](190000008.md), etc.

One Key to [Success](60139.md) is to store good, well defined and correct [Information](60007.md), that then leads to good [Results](60033.md) - In Contrast to current AI-Systems that have to process Tons of Bad-Data with an uncertain Outcome.

This is more [Work](60036.md) at the Beginning, but in the End it pays off, because lots of Re-Work can be avoided for Future-Work, which leads also to more [Fun](60037.md).

Through the [Connection](60006.md) of [Dings-Objects](300000001.md) much more [Value](700030.md) is created out of your Data and a lot of Redundancy is removed, which saves [Time](10000002.md), [Money](6666.md) and [Energy](10000040.md). It also leads to more Organization Clarity and reduces the current Chaos in our (personal) Digital-World.

## Basics <a id="2000"/>

### Objects <a id="2010"/>

There are [Dings-Objects](300000001.md) that are purly digital, as for Example this Document, but there are also Objects that have a Connection to Reality, for Example:

- [Michael_Holzheu](0.md)
- [Muffi](1971091151.md)
- [My-Pocket-Calculator](1971091108.md)

### Numbers <a id="2020"/>

All [Dings-Objects](300000001.md) have an unique [Dings-Number](300000015.md) that will be for Eternity. The Numbers can be used for internal [References](60039.md) and as [Address](611002.md) for the Internet or Intranet:

- Example: [https://dings.site/0.html](0.md)

### Names <a id="2030"/>

Each Dings-Object has a [Dings-Name](300000016.md), that can be changed. [References](60039.md) to the Object can use different Names, for Example:

- Besides of Programming [Mike](0.md), is also able to play Tennis.

### References <a id="2040"/>

As just seen, Dings-Objects can reference each other, which adds new Information for both Objects, for Example with every [Reference](60039.md) the System automatically learns alternative [Names](60048.md) for Dings-Objects in different Contexts:

```
$ dings list 0
0 "Michael-Georg_Holzheu"
  - Mike [All-Dings-Overview](300100001)
```

The more Documents reference Objects, the more Information is added to the System and Humans or AI are able to find this very easily:

```
$ dings list 1971091151
1971091151 "Muffi"
  - Muffi [All-Dings-Overview](300100001)
  - Muffi [About](21)
  - Muffi [Muffi-and-Schnuffi-Photo](400000001)
```

### Users <a id="2042"/>

The [Dings-User](300000037.md) is a special [Dings-Object](300000001.md) that can be verified by:

- [Digital-Passport](13300004.md)
- [World-Id](170100003.md)

### Definitions <a id="2050"/>

Each Dings-Object has a short [Definition](13000002.md) that should make clear, what exactly is meant, for Example:

- Michael-Georg_Holzheu is a [Human](40000001.md).

### Meanings<a id="2060"/>

Like the [Dings-Name](300000016.md), also the [Definition](13000002.md) can change, but the [Meaning](60002.md) of a [Dings-Object](300000001.md) should never change, for Example [Muffi](1971091151.md) with the associated [Dings-Number](300000015.md) 1971091151 will always be "The Muffi" of [My-Fellow-Occupant](88.md).

### Embeddings <a id="2060"/>

Besides of referencing Dings-Objects, they can also be embedded in other Objects, for Example [My-Calculator-Photo](400000105.md), that is included in this Document:

![Embedded Version](400000105.jpg)

### Apps <a id="2070"/>

Besides embedding simple Objects like Images or Sound, it is also possible to include [Dings-Apps](300000020.md) in Documents:

![The-Don't-Waste-App](400000050.quiz)

## Presenting <a id="3000"/>

The Dings-Objects are presented via [Html-Files](9000134.md), that can be shown in each [Browser](9000128.md).

There are three security Levels:

- Local
- Intranet (currently with Password)
- Internet

## Use-Cases <a id="4000"/>

### Medicine <a id="4010"/>

- [My-Fellow-Occupant-Medical-History](1000010002.md)

### Patents <a id="4020"/>

- [Zero-Wave-Device-Patent](300050001.md)

### Blogs <a id="4030"/>

- [About Michael](21.md)

### Science <a id="4040"/>

- [My-Doctorial-Thesis](333333333.md)
- [Pythagorean-Comma](23.md#10100)

### Education <a id="4041"/>

- [Over-Tone-App](23.md#10500)

### Accounting <a id="4050"/>

When Bills are stored in the Dings-System half-automatically the correct References are created. For Example, if the Dings-System already knows the Car-Insurance-Number, the Reference to the Contract can be make by automatically using OCR.
The Car-Insurance already has a Reference to the Car.

Therefore the User could ask the System for Example:

- How much did I pay for my Insurance the last Year?
- How much did I pay in total for may Car in the last three Years?

### Advertising <a id="4060"/>

If a Dings-User reads [My-Good-Meal-Blog](21.md#3300) and then goes to the Delhi-Palace, he could add a Comment that he likes or does not like the Chilli-Chicken.
In any Case the Delhi-Palace should give a Reward to the Blog-Writer. In Case the User likes the Food, the Writer of the Blog should also get
a Reward from the Dings-User.
