## Day-117: MPA-Final <a id="17000"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.11.02-14:00 at the Landrats-Amt  <a id="17002"/>
###### Topics: MPA, Politics, War, Peace, Women

Today I meet my dear [Mrs-N](1000001002.md) again to finally get back all my Driving-[Rights](670004.md) from [Our-Landrats-Amt](140100002.md). In the Office I also meet her [Boss](180000013.md), with whom I already had a "friendly" [Conversation](40202001.md) right at the [Beginning](60154.md) of my personal [Battle](1200000007.md) [[1]](#17051) with the [Paragraph-Riders](1200000006.md).

My [Impression](60041.md), that [Our-Strict-System](8000998.md) is *not* always fair to [Outsiders](180000014.md), was confirmed again some Minutes before, when I arrived with [My-Bulli](1971091102.md) and only one [Flag](141000009.md) was waving next to [Germany](140000025.md) in front of the [Landrats-Amt](250010001.md):

![Equal Rights for All?](400000160.jpg)

I can understand that also the [Family](180000008.md) of [Our-Mayor](70000069.md) might had to endure great [Suffering](10000111.md) due to [Crimes](670012.md) of the [National-Socialism](141000012.md), but can this *still* be a [Justification](600178.md) for this (at least for [Islamists](1200000004.md)) annoying [Provocation](41010010.md) in the multicultural [Tübingen](2000001.md)?

Well, since we don't have the [Tagblatt](2010040.md), I frankly admit my [Ignorance](600186.md) about the *real* [Facts](600181.md) behind this [Decision](60095.md) and the [Provocation](600078.md) of the (almost for sure) not *responsible* [Person](40000001.md) was just a simple [Trick](600187.md) for getting more [Publicity](60175.md), like [Master-Palmer](70000069.md) himself demonstrates it from Time to Time.

To be honest, in General I get most political [Information](60007.md) from [Colleagues](180000010.md), like my decided [Contenance-Trainer](1971091169.md), to whom I have at least more [Confidence](60015.md), than to eloquent [Jurists](670036.md), who (like he told me) get a big [Stage](60010007.md) from our so trustworthy [Public-Service-Broadcasters](191000003.md).

Howsoever, there are probably even more important [Topics](600051.md), like [Global-Warming](290000002.md) or [Waves](60156.md)...&nbsp;of [Refugees](141000013.md) and for me anyway at the Moment most [Relevance](600114.md) has the Settlement of yet another [MPA](1000001001.md)-[Bill](130000002.md):

![Last Payment?](400000163.jpg)

In Order to save [Money](6666.md) and [Time](10000002.md) for future Candidates, I then discuss one of my [Ideas](600012.md), where the Son of [Mrs-N](1000001002.md) might help with his refurbished [Motor-Bike](200500003.md) from [Suzuki](240000025.md):

![Similar Machine?](400000161.jpg)

After a wordy [Whats-App](9000047.md)-[Disupte](600185.md) with two [Girl-Friends](180000002.md) about Right and Wrong, back at Home I proudly present our glory [Solution](600024.md) to my [My-Skeptical-Occupant](88.md) and get into the next [Battle](1200000007.md), because she is a *real* [Fighter](1200000005.md) against [Combustion-Engines](200400008.md)&nbsp;-&nbsp;but perhaps we can get [Cease-Fire](1200000008.md) by using [Electric-Motor-Bikes](200500006.md) with more [Respect](41000005.md) for the female [Nature](60104.md):

###### Topics: 123-Friends, MPA, Feelings

After the stupid [Dussel-Test](#12000) Today I have my second [Exam](1100000002.md) to finally get back the [Motorbike-License](1100110001.md).

Due to [Illness](40800000.md) of the [Examiner](202000018.md) the [Testing](1100000002.md) was postponed and my last [Driving-Lesson](1100000014.md) is already a [Week](610008.md) ago&nbsp;-&nbsp;Now I feel little [Fear](10000109.md), that I have forgotten how to drive again.

Therefore, though the external [Conditions](60069.md) are almost perfect, because of [Nervousness](10000108.md) already at the first [Junction](1100000021.md) I take the wrong [Lane](100000022.md), which leads to [Connection](60006.md)-Problems with [Erik](150000005.md) and the [Examiner](202000018.md).

Fortunately shortly later we find ourself again [Am-Stadtgraben](2010039.md) and then drive to the [Training-Ground](1100100004.md), where this Time I behave like a *real* [Adult](670032.md) and pass all [Exercises](60138.md) without Problems.

Because I *really* feel [Relaxation](10000110.md) now, subsequently with high [Concentration](600145.md) I also manage the Rest of the [Program](60086.md) and finally arrive at our Starting-Point:

![Finally Success!](400000158.jpg)

There I have a Talk with the next [Examinee](404.md) about our [MPA-Process](1000001001.md), where he tells me a short [Story](60109.md) about his [Friend](180000002.md), who obviously also had some [Problems](600029.md) with our beloved [German-System](8000998.md):

> After his first [MPA-Test](1000001001.md), he was told to be 6 Months abstinent from [Alcohol](100100006.md) and then in the second MPA-Meeting, where he had the Impression that even the [Psychology](14000000.md)-Part went fine, the [Experts](12000000.md) still demanded another 6 Months of [Abstinence](404.md).

Come on Girls, really? A least regarding the last Point I made exactly the same [Experience](600096.md) in my fourth MPA [[0]](#17050) with my special "Friends" from [Tüv-Süd-Balingen](1000001007.md).

On the one Hand I feel [Happiness](10000112.md), that I am not alone with my [Problem](600029.md), but on the other Hand I feel also [Sadness](10000113.md) to see even more [Suffering](10000111.md) from this crazy [System](60052.md).

Howsoever, at least for me this [Nightmare](404.md) seems to be finally over now, and shortly later I even feel even some [Gratitude](41000009.md), when I eat a Piece of [Pizza](203500001.md) together with two [Good-Men](20000100003.md), I will never forget:

## Day-115: Men-Women-Universe <a id="15000"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.10.26-17:15 in Tübingen  <a id="15001"/>
###### Topics: Men, Women

Yesterday I had an [Argument](600151.md) about [Justice](600052.md) with my [My-Fellow-Occupant](88.md), where she made the [Claim](600078.md) that [Men](40080022.md) have much more [Contacts](10000039.md) with [Women](40000010.md) than the other Way round.

I respond, that this cannot be [The-Truth](600140.md), because for each [Contact](40000015.md) we normally have exactly one [Woman](40000010.md) and one [Man](40080022.md), so in total each [Group](180000000.md) must have the same [Number](60000.md) of [Contacts](40000015.md).

She pretends to me to not have understood my [Argumentation](600176.md), which of course cannot be [The-Truth](600140.md), because she is not bad at all in [Mathematics](13000000.md) and of course knows the [Formula](13000025.md) for the [Average-Ratio](12000060.md):

$$ Average(x_1,x_2 ..\:x_n) = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{x_i}}{n} $$
$$ = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + .. + x_n}{n} $$

The next Day, after a Walk with [Soey](142000001.md), I meet [Sarah](151000002.md) together with her [Father](40000007.md). Both look like rather inexperienced [Mathematicians](80000002.md) to me and therefore I try to explain them as simple as possible, why [Men](40080022.md) and [Women](40000010.md) are equal regarding [Fun-Contacts](60170.md).

So let's assume we have a [Micro-Universe](10000027.md) with only two Men _M1/M2_ and two Women _W1/W2_, where _M1_ has two Contacts with each of _W1/W2_, whereas _M2_ has Zero-Contacts.

Because each of the two Women have one Time Fun with _M1_ the [Variables](13000042.md) for the [Function](13000011.md) have the following [Values](700030.md):

$$ x_1 = Fun\_Count\_W1 = 1 $$
$$ x_2 = Fun\_Count\_W2 = 1 $$
$$ n = Women\_Count = 2 $$

Then we can calculate _Fun_per_Woman_ as Follows:

$$ Fun\_per\_Woman = Average(x_1,x_2) $$
$$ =  \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{2}{x_i}}{2} = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = \frac{1 + 1}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 $$

So on Average each Woman has one Time Fun - But now let's see, if Men *really* have more Fun, like my Friend claimed, so let's define first again the Variables:

$$ x_1 = Fun\_Count\_M1 = 2 $$
$$ x_2 = Fun\_Count\_M2 = 0 $$
$$ n = Men\_Count = 2 $$

Analogous to just now we now can also calculate the _Fun_per_Men_ as Follows:

$$ Fun\_per\_Man = Average(x_1,x_2) $$
$$ =  \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{2}{x_i}}{2} = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = \frac{2 + 0}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 $$

So for both Calculations the Result is One and therefore I proved my Hypothesis:

$$ Fun\_per\_Woman = Fun\_per\_Man $$

To verify [The-Truth](600140.md) even more, we can write a little [Python](9010003.md)-Program "Men-Women-Fun.py", where we first define the [Average-Function](12000060.md):

```python
def Average(X1_X2_Xn_List):
	List_Count = len(X1_X2_Xn_List)
	Sum = 0
	for Xi in X1_X2_Xn_List:
		Sum += Xi
	return Sum / List_Count
```

Then we write a Function for the Women&nbsp;...

```python
def Average_for_Women():
	Fun_Count_W1 = 1
	Fun_Count_W2 = 1
	return Average([Fun_Count_W1, Fun_Count_W2])
```
... and finally the Same for the Men:

```python
def Average_for_Men():
	Fun_Count_M1 = 2
	Fun_Count_M2 = 0
	return Average([Fun_Count_M1, Fun_Count_M2])
```

At the End we call our two Men/Women-Functions:

```python
print("Average for Women: " + str(Average_for_Women()))
print("Average for Men  : " + str(Average_for_Men()))
```

If we run the Program, we also get the correct Result:

```bash
$ python3 Men-Women-Fun.py
Average for Women: 1.0
Average for Men  : 1.0
```

I think Everybody agrees that we now answered by Means of [Mathematics](13000000.md) and [Informatics](9000000.md) the simple [Binary-Question](600138.md):

> Have Men and Women the same Amount of Fun-Contacts?

And the simple [Answer](600139.md) is:

> Yes!

But I have to admit, that though in [Theory](7000001.md) this looks like [Correctness](600077.md), nevertheless in [Reality](40000.md) the unbalanced Distribution can lead to *real* [Problems](600029.md), like [Loneliness](14000003.md) for _M2_ or [Overload](600177.md) of _M1_:

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.10.21-9:15 in Sankt-Luzen <a id="14002"/>
###### Topics: Choir, Women

This Week-End we have our yearly Meeting of the [Ernst-Bloch-Choir](2010013.md), where we train for the very last [Concert](60010005.md) with the [current](2010024.md) Musical-Lead in [Sankt-Luzen](2010036.md):

![Magic House](400000148.jpg)

Though out my Conviction that big is not always better, fortunately my [Machine](20000004.md) is still long enough to supply three Colleagues together with their Luggage:

![Big Thing](400000146.jpg)

Because we want to give our very Last for the Farewell-[Show](60010003.md), the (especially high:) [Voices](60096.md) are brought up to the [Limit](600026.md), and therefore this Time we really have to use some Aids:

![Voice Doping](400000145.jpg)

My first Program with the [Ernst-Bloch-Choir](2010013.md) was called [Heimat](2010025.md), which is a relevant Topic [[0]](#14050) for myself, because sometimes I feel like an old [Tree](260030006.md) without [Roots](60110.md):

![Uprooted Thing](400000144.jpg)

Though on one Side the Topic makes me a little bit sad, on the Other Side the *really* beatiful [Harmonies](60100.md) make my Life a little bit happier again.

The only *real* [Criticism](600174.md) I had, was the [Complexity](600023.md) of the [Messages](600175.md), which were already difficult to understand for "normal" [People](40000001.md) and almost "Mission-Impossible" for a "confused" [Man](40080022.md) like myself.

But at least from [Colleagues](180000010.md) I heard, that in this Respect the new Program will be easier to consume. Unfortunately (up to now) I did not listen (Shame on me) carefully enough to the explaining Inter-Texts, so for the Time being, I have to leave this [Question](600107.md) open:

![Simple Messages](400000149.jpg)

Though on the one Hand for the [Audience](600146.md) Understanding might get easier, on the Other [Singing](91001007.md) will get *really* hard for our [Bloch-Choir](2010013.md) and (with all Respect) would be "Mission-Impossible" even for the all but bad [Church-Singers](91001009.md) of [My-Chor-Lead-Double](1948102000.md):

![Good Mama](400000152.jpg)

Our [Noch-und-Noch-Nicht-Fertig-Werden](2010035.md) contains *really* high [Complexities](600023.md) in [Rhythm](60099.md) as well as in [Accord](60100.md), but I personally think it's *really* worth the Effort, because that leads to many unexpected, yet beloved [Surprises](60166.md) for the interested [Human-Ear](40101033.md).

And appropos Surprises [[1]](#14051): On the Week-End I learnt, that the [Creator](600098.md) of this brilliant [Work](700007.md) is also a very talented Voice-Immitator, so with all [Respect](41000005.md) I would call her now [Our-Composer-Witch](2010024.md):

## Day-113: Good Men and Women <a id="12300"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.10.20-20:00 with Mandy <a id="12302"/>
###### Topics: Arrogance, Men, Women, 123-Friends

After I finished the [Work](60036.md) for [My-Angry-House-Dragon](1971091142.md), I really need some Rest and therefore visit [Mandy](151000001.md) again. Though she also is quite strict with me, nevertheless the Time with her is much more in [Harmony](60100.md).

Ok, we don't know each other for such a long Time, but somehow it feels good and we have similar [Views](600028.md) on the [Life](60064.md), for Example we hate [Arrogance](41010006.md) the most.

To be fair, I occasionally also use this [Concept](600011.md) as a [Tool](600043.md) for [Humor](40201004.md) or as [Weapon](1200000003.md) for [The-Good](60120.md) or both [[0]](#12350) of it.

And appropos [Good](60120.md): Today I committed to my new [Secrets-Repository](300000032.md) two [Lists](60008.md) with [Names](60048.md) of 10 Good-[Men](40080022.md) and 10 Good-[Women](40000010.md).

Most of them are old [Friends](180000002.md) of mine, but also *really?* new Ones made it into my personal Top-10. Hopefully the List will grow soon and if we use *real* [Parallelism](10000103.md), like I rehearsed it Today with [My-Next-Good-Man](150000008.md), this can happen faster than you might expect:

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.10.20-14:30 at the Café-Bäcker-Mayer <a id="12301"/>
###### Topics: Men, Technology

I meet the depressive [Roland](150000008.md) at the [Bäckerei-Mayer](2010034.md) and use the [Opportunity](60164.md) to smoke a [Cigarillo](100100007.md) with him. My [Colleague](180000010.md) is an [Expert](12000000.md) for [Electronics](10400000.md), but also knows a Lot about [Computer-Science](9000000.md).

In the Following we discuss many [Concepts](600011.md) of [Parallism](10000103.md) in [Computer-Systems](9000153.md) and because my [Colleague](180000010.md) is especially experienced in [Hardware](9400000.md), he of course understands the Principles of Computer-Architectures, but he also seems to be quite familiar with the [Concepts](600011.md) of [Operating-Systems](9100000.md) and [Applications](9000055.md).

After about 30 Minutes Talk, I am almost sure to the have found One out of 10.000, who could claim to have "understood" most of this crazy [Technology](60044.md) - Perhaps not quite at my Level yet, but nevertheless a *really* good [Man](40080022.md)!

## Day-111: Dussel in Dusslingen <a id="12000"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.09.30-09:15 in Tübingen <a id="12001"/>
###### Topics: Motorbike, Show, Capitalism

Today I have my [Driving-Test](1100000002.md) on the [Motor-Bike](200500003.md), that finally should finish the endless MPA-Story [[0]](#12050). Because I am sure about my [Victory](60144.md), the [Plan](600045.md) is to deliver a little Farewell-[Show](60010003.md) and pass the Test while looking like a real [Dussel](668001.md). Of course all of the funny Stuff will be recorded with my secret [Helmet-Camera](20000017.md).

To create a perfect [Illusion](60146.md), already in the [Driving-Lessions](1100000014.md) I have made an Effort to play dumb. And obviously that was so convincing, that after numerous really silly [Failures](60074.md), my [Colleague](180000010.md) in greatest [Despair](10000059.md) even ripped out a heavy [Man-Hole-Cover](1102000002.md) with his bare [Hand](40101030.md):

![Despair in Dusslingen](400000101.jpg)

Fortunately [my](150000005.md) dear [Teacher](202000017.md) organized an [Examiner](202000018.md) with [Humor](40201004.md), who BTW is an Ex-[Soldier](202000020.md) and fittingly carries the same [Name](180000009.md) as the [Males](40000004.md) of our German [Wild-Boars](40210001.md).

First we drive to the Practice-Area near the beautiful [Recycling-Center](1103000002.md) of [Dußlingen](140000062.md), where a young [Bicyclist](1100000011.md) obviously does not give a Shit on our German [Traffic-Signs](1100000003.md):

![Young Dussel](400000098.jpg)

Oh Boy, it's high Time to grow up, really! But back to me: To make it not too obvious for my old Hares, I regularily switch between Wild-Boar- and Pussy-Style, so maximum Accellerations are followed by really slow and broad [U-Turns](1100000009.md).

Then I have to do the Excercises, of which the most dangerous One is called by our [Brave-Viking](150000005.md) simply My-[Kyrptonite](750001.md). Suddenly it looks like the two Traffic-Experts now somehow smelled the Rat and therefore try to test me more accurately.

I recognize that, because in the Following they invite me to do the Kyptonite-Test on the Side with the high [Curbs](1100000013.md), which means Kryptonite to the second Power. Though I now *really* feel some Respect for the Excercise, I nevertheless stick to my Plan and also manage this Test as concise as possible.

To entertain my [Audience](600146.md) a little bit more, on the subsequent Ride to Dußlingen-City I report wordy via [Radio](16000003.md) about my [Plans](600045.md) with the new Bike [[1]](#12051).

Then on my Right I recognize a dumb [Foreigner](600148.md), who obviously does not show any [Respect](41000005.md) to our German [Lines](1100000016.md):

![Disabled Dussel](400000102.jpg)

Come on Boy, your [Brain](40000026.md) isn't disabled, high Time to get more fucused, really! But back to me: So far Everything worked according to my [Plan](600045.md), but as we say in good old [German](600004.md):

> The Devil is known to be a Squirrel [[2]](#12052).

That might be true, but my personal [Suspicion](670033.md) since several Weeks is an alternative [Truth](600021.md):

> God is an Ass-Hole [[3]](#12053).

Unfortunately I know neither One nor the Other, so I have to rely on Myself and anyway - I am *the* [Man](40080022.md) here! Perhaps that was a little [Over-Estimation](41010007.md), because shortly later out of [Carelessness](41010008.md) I overlook a [30-Kmh-Zone-Sign](1100000005.md):

![Speed-Limit in Dusslingen](400000099.jpg)

Fortunately my Tester generously forgives my [Speeding-Misdemeanor](670030.md), but the [Joy](10000055.md) about that does not last very long, because Seconds later my Gaze completely looses [Focus](60143.md):

![Left-for-Right in Dusslingen](400000103.jpg)

Bad-Luck for me, because I do not check the [Right-for-Left-Rule](1100000007.md) properly and therefore the rutinated Tester has no other Choice than to make me fail the Driving-Test.

Oh Man, obviously this Time I really took it too far and the old Dream of passing every single [Test](60138.md) in one [Life](60064.md) is History now. Perhaps I should think about a little bit more [Discipline](41000004.md) in the Future.

Unlike my [Driver-Test-Friend](1000001017.md), I never joined the [Bundeswehr](1200000002.md) and therefore I am still a bit uncertain in the Field, but I will try my very Best, promised:

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.07.24-16:01 at the Kaufland <a id="10901"/>
###### Topics: Friends, Literature

My dear [Artist-Friend](1971091155.md) will probably soon move back to his old Appartment and therefore he asked me, if I could help him with [my](1971091106.md) Car to dispose his empty Bottles, which he collected in the Basement over a longer Period.

At first I am not too keen on the Action, but after we arrived at the [Kaufland](2010027.md) and I see the big Waste-Mountain in our Shopping-Carts, ...

![Our Waste-Mountain](400000048.jpg)

... suddenly the whole Thing looks more like an Adventure to me. I am curious, how much Money we will get out of this and estimate about 30 Euros for the [Deposit](130000029.md).

That was not a really bad Guess, but in case you want to know it exactly, I recommend my [new App](23.md#10901) to unravel the Mystery playfully.

After our "Work" I feel much better and when I report this back to my Friend, he tells me about the "[Tom_Sawyer](730001.md)-Effect", where even the most boring [Work](60036.md) can make [Fun](60037.md) - if you make it smart.

The Story he is referring to is from the Book [The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer](71000004.md), where the crafty Tom managed it to make his Friends paint a big Fence with Pleasure.

But who knows, perhaps the Author [Mark_Twain](70000044.md) would have choosen Nowadays Something like our small Waste-Story instead.

Unfortunately my [MPA-Story](1000001000.md) is still not over yet, because I did not get back my A-License [[0]](#10750) for the [Motor-Bike](200500003.md). The Explanation is that I have not had the Driving-Licence for longer than I have had it.

According to [§](670015.md) 20.2 [[1]](#10751) the Civil-Servants force me to redo the theoretical and the practical [Tests](600103.md), which probably will cost me again around 1.000 Euros.

Although I am a really frustrated about this, I am at least a little bit happy about the partly regained [Freedom](600020.md).

## Day-106: Movies again <a id="10600"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.07.17-13:36 in Tübingen <a id="10602"/>
###### Topics: Movie, Profession

I also can strongly recommend the Movie [The-Suicide-Squad](200040007.md) - at least the first Part. Like we [already](#10601) saw with [The-Orville](200030111.md), also here several [Movie-Genres](200300009.md) are combinded.

But this Time instead of the [Science-Fiction-Genre](270000025.md) the [Super-Hero-Genre](270000027.md) plays the [Root-Tone](90000027.md).

The Special-Effects are really impressive and the [CGI](2000217.md) looks almost real, for Example, when at the End of the [Film](200300000.md) a big Tower collapses into thousands of different Pieces.

Until the middle of the Movie it was extraordinary funny (at least for Adults), but then it gets more serious, which comes a bit suprisingly and IMHO "somehow" does not fit.

Nevertheless it was a great Performance of the whole Crew and BTW I can't remember, if I ever saw such a long List of [Stunt-Men](80000007.md) and [Stunt-Women](80000007.md) in my Life:

###### Topics: Movie, Star-Trek, Star-Wars

In the last Days I watched the third Season of [The-Orville](200030111.md), which is Part of the [Star-Trek-Universe](200030103.md) that originally was created by [Gene_Roddenberry](70000042.md).

I enjoyed especially the first five Episodes, because they virtuously combine different [Movie-Genres](200300009.md) like [Horror](270000010.md), [Action](270000023.md), [Comedy](270000024.md) and of course [Science-Fiction](270000025.md).

It is striking, that the [Creator](600098.md) [Seth_MacFarlane](70000043.md) has sacrificed some Principles of the good-old [Star-Trek](200030103.md), like scientfic Consistency and Seriousness. For Example, now the [Space-Ships](200600001.md) produce Sounds in the Vacuum similar to [Star-Wars](200035000.md).

In general [Seth_MacFarlane](70000043.md) included also a some other Elements form the Sister-Brand, for Example long Space-Battles or Space-Hunters. Especially in Episode 9 it gets obvious, where we could see a Scene that was copied from the famous Attack of the [X-Wings](200035001.md) on the gigantic [Death-Star](200035002.md).

I really loved the third Season, but what I did not like, was that too many new [Species](40000022.md) appeared without further Explanation and that in the Space-Battles all [Vessels](200600001.md) of the Federation looked like the Orville.

My favourite Character is the [Anroid](9100003.md) [Isaac](200030112.md), who has no Feelings and decides (at least most of the Time) only according the the Rules of [Logic](15000000.md), very much in the Tradition of his Colleagues [Data](200030110.md) and [Spock](200030114.md).

## Day-98: Spinoza and Brass <a id="9800"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.07.01-11:00 in the Klinke <a id="9801"/>
###### Topics: Philosophers-Club, Music

We have two Topics Today at our [Philosphers-Club](2010019.md), namely [Metha-Physics](645004.md) and the [Philospher](202000015.md) [Baruch_de_Spinoza](70000037.md).

Besides Others in the first Part there was discussed the [Theory-of-Ideas](645005.md) founded by [Platon](70000039.md) around 400 BC. The basic Concept is that somewhere exist the abstract [Ideas](600012.md) on how Things *should* be, e.g. the Idea of a round Circle or a perfect Square, but in our Reality we only can come close tho that [Ideal](600015.md). To me this Concept sounded always very plausible.

That also reminds me to many Discussions with my [Jehovah's-Witnesses](647002.md), where they told me that [God](647003.md) makes the [Claim](600028.md) to own the perfect [Ideas](600012.md), how the World should be. The [Devil](647004.md) has a different [Plan](600045.md), but in Principle claims the same. God lets his Counterpart do his bad Work in order to make the [Humans](40000001.md) finally understand, who is right.

The second [Podcast](700050.md) deals with the ideas of [Baruch_de_Spinoza](70000037.md), who was one of the First who claimed that God does not exist as a Person, but instead is an abstract Thing that is in All.

After our Meeting on the Way to the [Kichererbse](2010023.md) we come by a Band of the currently ongoing [Brass-Festival](400000036.md), where I notice an interesting [Instrument](90000020.md), that is called [Sousa-Phone](90000021.md):

![](400000036.jpg)

The Name comes from the [Man](40000004.md) [John_Sousa](70000038.md), who is said to have come up with the Idea for this Instrument. Probably you can make also good Music with such a [Brass](90000022.md), but from the Distance in our Meeting it sounded a bit weird:

On your Way back from the Hospital through the [Tübinger-Botanics-Garden](2010021.md) I got deeply impressed by a beatiful [Chestnut-Tree](260030003.md):

![Castanea sativa Mill.](400000033.jpg)

While decoding the [Latin](640044.md) Name "Castanea sativa Mill.", I ponder about the Meaning of "Mill". The Answer is that a [Man](40000004.md) named [Miller](70000036.md) invented the [Genus](40000024.md) "Castanea".

After the Tennis-Training I escort my [My-Fellow-Occupant](88.md) to the "Kopfschmerz-Ambulanz" in the [UKT](2010020.md). She reports that the [Triptan](800008.md) which she has been prescribed by the Doctor last Time makes her only sleepy, but it does not help against the [Head-Ache](48000005.md). After the Consultation-Hour, where she had about 99% of the Speaking-Part, the Doctor recommends Magnesium and Vitamin B2.

Afterwards we are invited by [our](70000034.md) European-Champion to a really relaxing Coffee-Break, where I sopontaneously sing together with my [Training-Partner](1971091141.md) a little Duett of [Gute-Nacht-Freunde](90100005.md) from [Reinhard_Mey](70000035.md), that IMHO already sounded quite nice.

On our weekly Match I manage it to win clearly with 6:0, 6:3 against my 25 Years older [Professor-Friend](1971091140.md). During a break, we address our Ignorance of whether the [Net-Supports](270000016.md) are used for Single- or Double-Matches:

Fourtunately [H.O](70000032.md) is there, who at the Moment gives Tennis-Lessons on the neighbouring Court and then tells us that those are used for Single-Matches.

Because we shoot a Ball outside the Court, after the Match I had to enter the Construction-Site, where currently [Land-Restoration](260030002.md) is done for the [Neckar](140000048.md):

Today our [Ernst-Bloch-Chor](2010013.md) has its last Concert with Songs from the "Heimat-Program". We perform together with the [SUSI-Chor](90001005.md) in [Freiburg](140000047.md) under the Headline "Eine andere Welt ist möglich".

IMHO both [Choirs](90001000.md) delivered a really good Preformance and especially regarding the Dynamics [we](2010013.md) reached our Maximum.

The Event is located in the "Bürgerhaus Seepark", which is beautifully situated on a Lake:

Suitable for the Evening's Topic the two Choirs together present the Song "[Wann?](400000027.md)" from [Rio_Reiser](70000030.md), that I also recorded last Year for my "Project Heimat" [[0]](#9102) according to the [Choral-Set](91001006.md) made by [Ansgar_Rettner](70000031.md):

###### Topics: Tennis, Wimbledon

After the Tennis-Match with my Colleague and a good Meal at the [Delhi-Palace](18071962.md), I play the first [Mixed-Double](270000014.md) together with my [Wimbledon-Win-Friend](1971091141.md). Although it is only a Fun-Match, I really want to find out, how strong we are as a [Team](180000006.md) and therefore I act very focused.

As a Result we win clearly in two [Sets](270200007.md). But afterwards I get the Impression that the [Mood](14000002.md) of all four Protagonists is not the very best. Maybe also because especially the [Serves](270000015.md) have been quite disappointing.

But at least we are now one Step further on our Roadmap to [Wimbledon](270200009.md) and BTW, Today we experimented already with our joint Outfit in Blue.

Style is important, no Question, but first of all probably a little bit more [Training](600100.md) is required:

Because of a Depression the last Days have been really painful and I barely left the Bed. Fortunately I bought the new Computer-Game [Diablo-IV](280000006.md):

![Diabolo-IV in the Bed](400000018.jpg)

As a big [Hero](60020003.md) in my Fight for [The-Good](60120.md) I kill thousands of [Monsters](60020001.md). My dangerous Opponent is [Lilith](280000008.md), who is the evil [Daughter](40000009.md) of the perhaps even more evil [Mephisto](280000009.md).

The Name of the [Dark-Lady](60020004.md) reminds me to the [Lilith-Computer](201000005.md) that was created by the Computer-[Legend](70000000.md) [Niklaus_Wirth](70000028.md). He once told me that he never was a big Fighter, so he probably would not have liked the quite violent Computer-Game very much.

The same as my [Father](40000007.md), who at least would have enjoyed the really beatiful Computer-Graphics with this [Grey-Heron](260010005.md) I recently met in the Swamps:

## Day-76: MPA-Plan for Cologne <a id="7600"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.09-21:52 in Tübingen <a id="7601"/>
###### Topics: MPA

Today I came up with the following [Strategy](160000000.md) for my fifth [MPA](1000001001.md) in [Cologne](140000026.md):

- I will again present the "best" Testimonies, which should prove that I normally don't drink and drive.
- The Talk to "Stefan" changed my Mind: I see now that I had an [Alcohol](100100006.md)-Problem and therefore decided to abstain completely now, also because in the Time without that [Drug](100100001.md), I felt much better.
- Almost one and a half Years of Abstinence should be Prove enough, that I am able to do this.
- For the very unlikely Case that this does not work, I can still point out, that also with Alcohol I was able to separate Dinking from Driving (see Testimonies).
- Especially after the whole painful and expensive MPA-Torture, as a Burnt-Child I will prevent similar Incidents in the Future under all Circumstances.

Sounds like a good Plan?

This Evening I will call am Man, who already made five successful MPAs and hope that he can give me some Tips, how to be successful this time.

## Day-72: Back to the Future <a id="7200"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.05-01:00 in Tübingen <a id="7201"/>
###### Topics: Movie

In the Night I watch together with my dear Friend "Sarah" and my beloved [House-Dragon](1971091142.md) one of our favourite Movies [Back-to-the-Future](200040006.md).

I always identfied myself a little bit with the Main-Actor [Michael_J_Fox](70000025.md), who unfortunately suffers under [Parkinson](48000014.md) since a long Time.

And of course I love the crazy Scientist "Doc Brown" played by [Christopher_Loyed](70000026.md) and admire [Crispin_Glover](50000028.md) for his brilliant Acting-Performance, when impersonating the shy Looser-Type "George McFly".

Last but not least I would like to mention the Sound-Track with the great Song [The-Power-of-Love](90100003.md) from [Huey_Lewis](70000027.md).

## Day-71: Movie "2 Fast 2 Furious" <a id="7100"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.04-00:00 in Tübingen <a id="7101"/>
###### Topics: Movie, English

After finishing Day-70, I watch the [2-Fast-2-Furious](200040004.md), which is the second [Movie](200300000.md) of the [Fast-and-Furious-Series](200040002.md). Compared to the [The-Fast-and-The-Furious](200040003.md) I like it better.

The Team of the white [Paul_Walker](70000020.md) with his steel-blue [Eyes](40101001.md) and the black [Tyrese_Gibson](70000023.md) reminded me a little bit to [Terrence_Hill](70000021.md) and [Bud_Spencer](70000022.md), although IMHO compared to Paul, Terrence is the better Actor.

Somehow I missed [Vin_Diesel](70000024.md), who was Part of the first two Episodes that I have seen so far.

I watched the Movie in [English](600006.md) and found it quite hard (again) to understand the [American-English](640042.md), especially spoken by [Tyrese](70000023.md). The Accent of [Paul](70000020.md) sounds more like aristocratic [British-English](640043.md), which is much easier for me.

## Day-70: About Moral <a id="7000"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.03-22:01 in Tübingen <a id="7002"/>
###### Topics: Philosophics, AI

After all I made the Decision to add my (under Circumstances wrong) Definition to All-Dings and also asked [Chat-GPT](9000150.md), how it would define this Concept, so "Chat-GPT: Define the Term Moral!":

> Moral refers to the principles, values, and beliefs that guide and influence individuals or societies in distinguishing right from wrong and in determining what is good or bad. It is a system of ethical principles and standards that shape and govern human behavior and interactions.
>
> Moral frameworks vary across cultures, religions, and philosophical perspectives, but they often include fundamental principles such as honesty, fairness, compassion, integrity, respect for others, and the promotion of well-being. Morality provides a foundation for individuals to make judgments about the consequences and ethical implications of their _actions_.
>
> Moral reasoning involves the ability to assess and evaluate the morality of a situation or _decision_, considering factors such as intentions, consequences, rights, and duties. It involves understanding and applying ethical principles and norms to guide behavior and make choices that align with one's moral values.

Not bad at all, isn't it? Well at least it also used the Terms "Decisions" and "Actions" as I did in my Definition respectively Python-Program. 

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.03-11:00 in Tübingen <a id="7001"/>
###### Topics: Philosophics

Today I visit the [Philosophers-Club](2010019.md) in the [Klinke](2010018.md), where we always hear Contributions to diverse Questions of [Philosophics](645000.md). This Time we choose a Podcast that discusses the Topic [Moral](645003.md).

The Speaker means that in his Opinion [Definitions](13000002.md) are mostly either trivial or wrong. I still hope that this is not true and I have already several concrete Proposals for defining that complicated Thing.

For Example, something like "Moral is a [Measure](10000021.md) for [Decisions](60095.md) to achieve a [Goal](60058.md)". Here a Proposal for a [Pyhthon](9010003.md)-Program to calculate this Measure:

```python
def Profit(Person, Descision)
    World_1 = World(Current)
    Value_1 = World_1.Get_Value_For(Person)
    World_2 = World_1.Do_Actions(Person, Decision)
    Value_2 = World_2.Get_Value_For(Person)
    return Value_2 - Value_1

def Measure_Moral():
    Profit_Sum = 0
    for Ding in All_Dings.List:
        Profit_Sum += Profit(Ding, Ding.Next_Decision())
    return Profit_Sum
```

But this Definition might be wrong, so as a Decision for the Time being let's formulate it trivial, but at least correct:

```
Moral is a Concept in Philosophics.
```

BTW, I called our Meeting "Philosophers-Club", because this is the Term I personally use most often. But the official Name is [Philosophie verständlich gemacht](2010019.md) and other Crew-Members call it also simply [Philo-Kurs](2010019.md).

After the disillusioning Phone-Call with the Amts-Gericht I feel more at the Mercy of the German-System than ever before and my [Depression](48000012.md) that I already had for several Days gets even worse.

On a Walking-Round I thought about my Options and I come up with the Idea of reading the Book [Urteils-Bildung-in-der-Fahreignungs-Begutachtung](1000001009.md).

In all four Expertises this Book has been used as Justification for the negative Assessments:

Die Bedingungen nach den Beurteilungskriterien, Urteilsbildung in der Fahreignungsbegutachtung,
sind nicht in ausreichendem Maße erfüllt.

For References in my planned Analyis I first create a digital Version of the analog Print:

The main Reason is that the Psychologists are the Experts, who will be believed. Besides that in the case of a Defeat I have to carry the Costs for the Judge and the Lawyer for the other Side.

Because I don't agree with the [Decision](60095.md) of [Mrs-H](1000001005.md) and [Mr-V](1000001006.md) in [my](1000001000.md) last [MPA](1000001001.md), I call the [Amts-Gericht-Tübingen](2010016.md) for asking, how I can take legal Actions against [Tüv-Süd](240000012.md).

I explain the Facts of the Case to a friendly Woman, who then tells me that she first needs to do a bit more Research on this Topic. I should first send her the last MPA-[Expert-Report](700043.md) and then she wants to contact me Tomorrow again.

What I also learnt from her, is that beginning with a [Dispute-Value](670010.md) of 5.000,- Euro the [Legal-Proceeding](670011.md) will be done by a [Land-Gericht](680002.md) and no longer by the [Amts-Gericht](680001.md).

BTW, in that Case a [Lawyer](202000012.md) unfortunately is mandatory.

###### Topics: Economics, Double-Standards

Had a longer Talk to the Owner of [my](2010008.md) Butcher-Shop, where he told me some Thories about the current [Inflation](60062.md). In his Opinion the Problem is that the [Trading-Companies](130020001.md) seize the Opportunity and charge excessive [Prices](130000012.md). Obviously only little of the Money reaches the Bottom and while some People earn themself a golden Nose the [Producing-Companies](130000018.md) get into Trouble.

This [Stratgy](160000000.md) seems to work, because there are still enough wealthy People, who are willing pay the high Prices.

After I noted, that that sounds like [Fraud](41010002.md) to me, he did not deny it and asked the interesting Question, why the [Bundes-Kartell-Amt](8020001.md) obviously is doing nothing against that.

Finally he told me a little Story about the Calibration-Office, which obviously created a lot of Stress because of a minimal Deviation in his Scale. On the other Hand it is common Knowledge, that on the [Canstadter-Wasen](270000007.md) the Beer-Glases are rarely full.

This confirms my Suspicion that in our Society more and more [Double-Standards](41010003.md) are applied and then the Small-People have to spoon out the Soup.

###### Topics: Tradition, House-Dragon

At least in South-[Germany](140000025.md) there is a [Tradition](270000005.md) that in the Night of [May-Day](270000006.md) our [Teen-Agers](40000020.md) are allowed to play [Pranks](41020000.md) and we became Victims of one.

Someone threw an Egg to our Window and it took me a While to clean up the Mess. My [House-Dragon](1971091142.md) was already for two Days on 180 and that was the final Straw. I had to mobilise all my Strength to tame the Beast at least a little bit.

###### Topics: Movie, Old-Heroes

Watched the last [Episode](200300007.md) of the third [Season](200300006.md) of the [Series](200300003.md) [Star-Trek-Picard](200030101.md), the [Borg](200030104.md) have again defeated once again, perhaps now forever.

I liked this Season because of the really great [Special-Effects](200300008.md) and the exciting [Story](60109.md), even if Sometimes [Logic](600038.md) has been sacrificed for Simplicity.

And of course the Best is, that almost all [Star-Trek-NG](200350100.md) Heroes have been on Board again, e.g. besides of [Captain_Picard](200030105.md) my Favorites have been [Seven-of-Nine](200030106.md), [Worf](200030108.md) and of course the [Geordi_La_Forge](200030109.md) and his [Android](200400004.md)-Friend [Data](200030110.md).

IMHO all of them are even better than in their younger Days, especially [Michael_Dorn](70000017.md), the [Actor](202000010.md) of [Worf]200030108.md) made a huge Step forward.

I like the Ukrainian [Winston](100100002.md)-Cigarette, it tastes similar to my red [Gauloises](100200001.md). On my Walk I meet some very loud [Joungsters](40000020.md), who seem to have consumed a lot of [Alcohol](100100006.md). One of the Boys obviously tried to eat a [Gänseblümchen](260020001.md) and the Girl in the Crew is worried about her Colleague because the [Flower](260020000.md) contains some [Poison](100400000.md).

As Farewell-Present the kind Man hands me over one [Winston](100100002.md)-Cigarette.

BTW, I was wrong with my [last](#3304) [Claim](600078.md) that a Chicken-Curry with two [Hefe-Weizen](203000001.md) without [Alcohol](100100001.md) is 24 Euro, the exact Price AFAIR is currently 22,70 Euro.

## Day-31: Chat-GPT <a id="3100"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.24-15:08 in Tübingen <a id="3110"/>
###### Topics: AI

After [Yesterday](#3008)'s Conversation I now register at the [Open-AI](240000008.md)'s Website with my Google-Id and then I try the first Example:

```
Who is Konrad Zuse?
```
```
Konrad Zuse (1910-1995) was a German engineer and computer pioneer who is credited with creating the world's first programmable computer. He began work on his first computer, the Z1, in 1936 while working as an engineer for the Henschel aircraft company in Berlin. The Z1 was completed in 1938 and used binary arithmetic and Boolean logic.

Zuse went on to build several more computers, including the Z2, Z3, and Z4, which were used for scientific and engineering calculations during World War II. His work was largely unknown outside of Germany during the war, but after the conflict ended, Zuse continued to work on computing projects and founded his own computer company, which he ran until his retirement in 1969.

Zuse is considered one of the most important pioneers in the field of computing and his work laid the foundation for the development of modern computers. He was awarded several honors during his lifetime, including the Werner von Siemens Ring in 1964, and is remembered today as a visionary inventor and engineer.
```

Looks like a really good Summary, but at least I found one potential [Error](60074.md), nameley AFIK the [Zuse-Z4](201000004.md) has been completed *after* the World-War-II, so most likely it was not used for Calculations during the War.

While putting my new baught Clothes from [Armani](240000002.md) in the Closet one Thing struck me: The [Boxer-Short](204000002.md) has a 16 [Centi-Meter](10000018.md) long [Laundry-Label](204000003.md) that is firmly sewed on the Piece of Clothing.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.11-14:OO in the Philosophen-Weg <a id="1804"/>
###### Topics: Physics

I ask my Neighbor, who is a [Professor](202000005.md) in [Physics](10000000.md), where the [Energy](10000009.md) remains, when two identical [Electro-Magnetic-Waves](10000012.md) with a [Phase-Angle-Shift](10000079.md) of 180 [Angle-Degrees](13000006.md) eliminate each other.

Because as a Result I would expect a [Zero-Wave](404.md) that carries no more Energy, which would violate the [Energy-Conservation-Law](10000017.md).

My Neighbor-Professor has not much [Time](10000002.md) and just tells me quickly that the Energy is somehow transformed into a different Form.

To clarify this, I call my Friend [Joachim](1971091158.md), who is Professor for [Mathematics](13000000.md), but also sometimes works in the Physics-Arena. After some Discussion we came to the [Theory](7000001.md), that a Electro-Magnetic-Wave carries/produces two Kinds of "Energy", namely the [Electric-Field](10000013.md) and the [Magnetic-Field](10000014.md).

A "normal" Wave makes both of it, but the resulting Zero-Wave would only produce a Magnetic-Field.

So as I understood it now, when two Waves eliminate each other, their "Electric-Energy" is transformed into "Magnetic-Energy" and the resulting Zero-Wave has an [Amplitide](10000015.md) of Zero and an infinite [Frequency](10000016.md).

Sounds good, but is that [The-Truth](600140.md)?
