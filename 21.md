## 2023.04.12

###### 10003
#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.12-14:46 in Tübingen

While putting my new baught Clothes from [Armani](240000002.md) in the Closet one Thing struck me: The [Boxer-Short](204000002.md) has a 16 [Centi-Meter](10000018.md) long [Laundry-Label](204000003.md) that is firmly sewed on the Piece of Clothing. This is not very comfortable to wear and it as always been a [Riddle](60046.md) to me, how that is thought.

###### 10002
#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.12-15:14 in Tübingen

While writing about the Clothing-Riddle, I notice that the Boxer-Shorts from the elitist Company from [Italy](140000021.md) are produced in [Myanmar](140000022.md).

###### 10001
#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.12-15:28 in Tübingen

While unpacking the rest of the Clothings, I realize that my new [Track-Suite](204000004.md) was produced in [Cambodia](140000023.md).

###### 9000
## 2023.04.11

###### 9008
#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.11-12:30 in Tübingen

I make some Research [0], where to make my next [Medical-Psychological-Assessment](1000001001).

###### 9007
#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.11-12:30 on my Way to the Butcher-Shop

I meet a [Mother](40000008.md) with her young [Daughter](40000009.md) riding a Fun-Pro-Scooter. We first discussed the [Technology](60044.md) of this [Vehicle](200500000.md) and afterwards I briefly showed her my Project. At the End she says that she would call that a [Hobby](60045.md), which then reminds me that I should define the Meaning of [Work](60036.md) a bit more.

###### 9006
#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.11-12:40 at the Butcher-Shop

I order [Schäufele](203400001.md) and the female [Seller](202000004.md) explaines me that the Thing I want is called [Kassler](203400002.md).

###### 9005
#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.11-14:OO in the Philosophen-Weg

I ask my Neighbor, who is a [Professor](202000005.md) in [Physics](10000000.md), where the [Energy](10000009.md) remains, when two identical [Electro-Magnetic-Waves](10000012.md) with a [Phase-Angle-Shift](10000011.md) of 180 [Angle-Degrees](13000006.md) eliminate each other.

Because as a Result I would expect a [Zero-Wave](404.md) that carries no more Energy, which would violate the [Energy-Conservation-Law](10000017.md).

My Neighbor-Professor has not much Time and just tells me quickly that the Energy is somehow transformed into a different Form. 

To clarify this, I call my Friend Joachim, who is Professor for Mathematics, but also sometimes works in the Physics-Arena. After some Discussion we came to the [Theory](7000001.md), that a Electro-Magnetic-Wave carries/produces two Kinds of "Energy", namely the [Electric-Field](10000013.md) and the [Magnetic-Field](10000014.md).

A "normal" Wave makes both of it, but the resulting Zero-Wave would only produce a Magnetic-Field.

So as I understood it now, when two Waves eliminate each other, their "Electric-Energy" is transformed into "Magnetic-Engergy" and the resulting Zero-Wave has an [Amplitide](10000015.md) of Zero and an infinite [Frequency](10000016.md).

Sounds good, but is that right?

###### 9004
#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.12-04:34 in the Philosophen-Weg

Smoked three last Cigarettes that makes then almost one Package Today:

Told my [Flat-Mate](180000005.md) that I would miss her, if she would die and she responded that she also would be very sad about that.

###### 9002
