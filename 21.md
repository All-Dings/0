## Day-47: MPA and Amts-Gericht-Tübingen <a id="4700"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.10-15:25 in Tübingen <a id="4701"/>
###### Topics: MPA, Amts-Gericht-Tübingen, Juristics

Because I don't agree with the [Decision](60095.md) of [Mrs_H](1000001005.md) and [Mr_V](1000001006.md) in [my](1000001000.md) last [MPA](1000001001.md), I call the [Amts-Gericht-Tübingen](2010016.md) for asking, how I can take legal Actions against [Tüv-Süd](240000012.md).

I explain the Facts of the Case to a friendly Woman, who then tells me that she first needs to do a bit more Research on this Topic. I should first send her the last MPA-[Expert-Report](700043.md) and then she wants to contact me Tomorrow again.

What I also learnt from her, is that beginning with a [Dispute-Value](670010.md) of 5.000,- Euro the [Legal-Proceeding](670011.md) will be done by a [Land-Gericht](680002.md) and no longer by the [Amts-Gericht](680001.md).

BTW, in that Case a [Lawyer](202000012.md) unfortunately is mandatory.

###### Topics: MPA, Beer, Controled-Alcohol-Consumption

While walking to my Butcher-Shop, I thought about the Advise of [Mr_W](1000001008.md) that it would be better to prove by controlled regular Drinking, that I can control my Alcohol-Consumption. Spontaneously I buy at the [Marktladen](2010017.md) for almost 20 Euro 10 Bottles of [Beer](203000003.md) with the firm Resolution to start controlled Drinking Tomorrow.

After I come back to my Appartment, I order two [Alcohol-Meassuring-Devices](20000011.md) from Amazon. My current Plan is to document the Alcohol-Consumption in the next Weeks.

But as I write this, I am not 100% sure, if I will do that all ...

## Day-46: MPA and Hacker <a id="4600"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.09-11:40 in Tübingen <a id="4502"/>
###### Topics: Hacker

Got a Telephone-Call from my Health-Insurance that they have been hacked and therefore the Heil-und-Kostenplan cannot be sent at the Moment.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.09-08:40 in Crona-Kliniken-Tübingen <a id="4501"/>
###### Topics: MPA

Made a [new](11091971.md#10007) Appointment for my 5th [MPU](1000001001.md) in at the [IBBK-Köln](240000006.md).

## Day-45: Finish Smoking <a id="4500"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.08-16:00 on a Eating-Round <a id="4501"/>
###### Topics: Smoking-Study

I smoked the last Cigarette from my [Smoking-Box](100100004.md) of Red-[Gauloises](100200001.md) and decided that this is my last one for the Time being. I feel somehow sad, but but I don't know the real [Reason](600030.md) for that.

## Day-44: Art-Karlsruhe <a id="4400"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.07-22:22 in Tübingen <a id="4401"/>
###### Topics: Art-Karlsruhe, Men

Today I drove together with my Aritst-Friend and "Markus" to Art-[Karlsruhe](140000042.md), which is a huge Exhibition in the Trade-Fair-Center. After some interesting Conversations with Artists and a lot of Walking I was so exhausted, that I desperately needed one Hour Rest in the Sun. Nevertheless it was a nice Day, where we had a lot of interesting Mens-Talk.

## Day-42: Just Day 42 <a id="4200"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.06-00:30 in Tübingen <a id="4201"/>
###### Topics: Famous-Number

Out of current Occasion I added the famous Number [42](13010002.md) to my Dings, also of course in Honor of [Douglas_Adams](70000019.md), who wrote the Book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" or in German [Per_Anhalter_durch_die_Galaxis](71000003.md). In the Story it is claimed that "42" is the Answer to the ultimate Question about Everything. But let's be honest, that can't be it, can it?

## Day-41: Good-Life Day <a id="4100"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.05-02:14 in Tübingen <a id="4104"/>
###### Topics: Muffi, Schnuffi, Photo

After I finally [updated](23.md#4104) my Rendering-Process, I now want to present a relatively new Photo from our dear Friends [Muffi](1971091151.md) and [Schnuffi](1971091152.md):

<img src="400000001.jpg" alt="Muffi-and-Schnuffi" style="width:800px;"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.04-17:35 in the Bus <a id="4102"/>
###### Topics: German-Women, Landes-Theater-Tübingen

In the Bus I noticed the somehow special Pantyhose of a Woman with pretty [Legs](40080008.md) and asked her about that. She seems to be surprised and ment that one better should look at the Face. When I told her about my [Thesis](600028.md) that making [Compliments](41000002.md) to [Women](40000010.md) in [Germany](140000025.md) can be dangerous for a Man, she agreed to me.

BTW, In the further Conversation I also learned that she is the new [Manager](80000005.md) of the [LTT](2010012.md), where I will be [soon](11091971.md#10006) with the [Ernst-Bloch-Choir](2010013.md) for our final Gala-Performance of the "Heimat-Programm".

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.04-12:45 with my Artist-Friend <a id="4103"/>
###### Topics: Philosopy, Good-Life

After a chilling [Breakfast](270000004.md) with my Artist-Friend, we climb the steep [Österberg](2010014.md), where we then have a long diverting Conversation about a possible [Good-Life](60066.md) and other interesting Topics in [Philosophy](645000.md). When we walk back, I still get the Idea of visiting Diana again, but unfortunately she seems to be busy at the Moment.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.04-12:40 at Bäckerei-Gehr Mühlstraße <a id="4101"/>
###### Topics: My-Brezel-Study

After my Tennis-Training, I baught four [Brezels](203410001.md) for 3,80 Euro and the [Sales-Girl](202000004.md) claimed that [Prices](130000012.md) in all Gehr-Branches are the same.

## Day-40: Hair-Analysis and Double-Standards <a id="4000"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.03-16:10 on an Eating-Round <a id="4005"/>
###### Topics: Inflation, Small-People, Double-Standards

Had a longer Talk to the Owner of [my](2010008.md) Butcher-Shop, where he told me some Thories about the current [Inflation](60062.md). In his Opinion the Problem is that the [Trading-Companies](130020001.md) seize the Opportunity and charge excessive [Prices](130000012.md). Obviously only little of the Money reaches the Bottom and while some People earn themself a golden Nose the [Producing-Companies](130000018.md) get into Trouble.

This [Stratgy](160000000.md) seems to work, because there are still enough wealthy People, who are willing pay the high Prices.

After I noted, that that sounds like [Fraud](41010002.md) to me, he did not deny it and asked the interesting Question, why the [Bundes-Kartell-Amt](8020001.md) obviously is doing nothing against that.

Finally he told me a little Story about the Calibration-Office, which obviously created a lot of Stress because of a minimal Deviation in his Scale. On the other Hand it is common Knowledge, that on the [Canstadter-Wasen](270000007.md) the Beer-Glases are rarely full.

This confirms my Suspicion that in our Society more and more [Double-Standards](41010003.md) are applied and then the Small-People have to spoon out the Soup.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.03-11:03 at the Train-Station <a id="4004"/>
###### Topics: GFR-Excuses

While waiting on the Train, I hear once more [one](8011003.md) of the known [GFR-Excuses](8011000.md).

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.03-10:35 in Stuttgart <a id="4003"/>
###### Topics: Zanzibar, Alkohol-Hair-Analysis

While a friendly [Woman](40000010.md) takes a [Probe](640002.md) of my Head-[Hair](40000025.md), I complain about my bad [Experiences](600096.md) with the [System](600083.md) in [Germany](140000025.md).

She agrees and tells me about her [Plans](600045.md) to leave the [Country](140000020.md). One of her Favourites is [Zanzibar](140000039.md), but before her Departure she first wants to earn some more [Money](6666.md) here.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.03-10:00 at the Train-Station Stuttgart <a id="4005"/>
###### Topics: GFR, Delay

My Train made an unplanned Stop in [Bad-Cannstadt](140000041.md) and arrived with about 15 Minutes [Delay](600095.md). Fortunately I still have enough Time.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.03-09:00 at the Bus-Station <a id="4002"/>
###### Topics: Flower, Ranunculus-Acris, Taraxacum-Officinale

At the Bus-Station I recognize some common German [Flowers](260020000.md), namely the [Scharfer Hahnenfuß](260020002.md) and the [Gewöhnlicher Löwenzahn](260020003.md), that already transformed into a [Pusteblume](404.md).

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.03-08:02 in Tübingen <a id="4001"/>
###### Topics: Deutschland-Ticket, Hair-Analyis, MPA

After last Night I had Problems with my [Debit-Card](130000014.md) in the Morning it worked to buy the new [Deutschland-Ticket](8011004.md). Very good, because Today I go to [Stuttgart](140000011.md) again for the 5th [Hair-Analyis](1000001004.md) for my [MPA](1000001000.md).

## Day-39: Price for the Best <a id="3900"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.02-14:30 on a Eating-Round <a id="3901"/>
###### Topics: Pattern, Stress, Competition, Philosophics

While walking to my Butcher-Shop, I think about the last Days, where I felt [Stress](600082.md), because Things did not go forward fast enough. I decide to make it slowly and concentrate on the [Nature](60104.md) like singing [Birds](260010000.md) and beatiful [Plants](260030000.md).

I ask myself, why I am so focused on having [Success](60108.md) with my Project and was reminded to an Interview with [Kurt_Tepperwein](70000018.md), where he gave the Advise to make your [Life](60064.md) unique somehow.

One common [Pattern](60112.md) for reaching this [Goal](60058.md) is to use [Competition](600094.md), e.g. who makes the best Pizza or who invents the best Programming-Language.

So being the [Best](60065.md) seems to be important for many People and this is true also for myself.

## Day-38: Round-Robin and Botanics <a id="3800"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.01-20:30 on a Smoking-Round with Diana <a id="3802"/>
###### Topics: Tooth-Pain, Diana, Botanics

My Neighbour Diana has strong [Tooth-Pain](48000010.md) since some Days and asks for some [Analgesics](810003.md). Fortunately [my](1971091142.md) Room-Mate has some [Paracetamol](810004.md) for her.

We then make together a small Smoking-Round and speak about the [Schizophrenia](48000011.md) of a Friend.

After Diane told me that [Labkraut](260030001.md) is etable, I try one and find the [Taste](40200002.md) to be good.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.01-10:00 at the TCT <a id="3801"/>
###### Topics: TCT, Round-Robin-Tournament-Tübingen

Played the [Round-Robin-Tournament-Tübingen](270200010.md) and finished Second out of 10 Participants. The traditional Event was held for about 70 Times at the [TCT](270000011.md).

## Day-37: Sunday and Erster-Mai <a id="3700"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.05.1-00:10 in Tübingen <a id="3702"/>
###### Topics: Erster-Mai, Tradition, House-Dragon

At least in South-[Germany](140000025.md) there is a [Tradition](270000005.md) that in the Night of [May-Day](270000006.md) our [Teen-Agers](40000020.md) are allowed to play [Pranks](41020000.md) and we became Victims of one.

Someone threw an Egg to our Window and it took me a While to clean up the Mess. My [House-Dragon](1971091142.md) was already for two Days on 180 and that was the final Straw. I had to mobilise all my Strength to tame the Beast at least a little bit.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.30-15:00 in Tübingen <a id="3701"/>
###### Topics: Breakfast

After Wake-Up, I take it easy: While our beautiful [Sun](10500003.md) is shining through the Windows, I enjoy [Coffee](203000002.md) and tasty [Breakfast](270000004.md) in my Bed.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.29-05:08 in Tübingen <a id="3503"/>
###### Topics: Star-Trek-Picard, Old-Heroes

Watched the last [Episode](200300007.md) of the third [Season](200300006.md) of the [Series](200300003.md) [Star-Trek-Picard](200030101.md), the [Borg](200030104.md) have again defeated once again, perhaps now forever.

I liked this Season because of the really great [Special-Effects](200300008.md) and the exciting [Story](60109.md), even if Sometimes [Logic](600038.md) has been sacrificed for Simplicity.

And of course the Best is, that almost all [Star-Trek-NG](200350100.md) Heroes have been on Board again, e.g. besides of [Captain_Picard](200030105.md) my Favorites have been [Seven-of-Nine](200030106.md), [Worf](200030108.md) and of course the [Geordi_La_Forge](200030109.md) and his [Android](200400004.md)-Friend [Data](200030110.md).

IMHO all of them are even better than in their younger Days, especially [Michael_Dorn](70000017.md), the [Actor](202000010.md) of [Worf]200030108.md) made a huge Step forward.

I like the Ukrainian [Winston](100100002.md)-Cigarette, it tastes similar to my red [Gauloises](100200001.md). On my Walk I meet some very loud [Joungsters](40000020.md), who seem to have consumed a lot of [Alcohol](100100006.md). One of the Boys obviously tried to eat a [Gänseblümchen](260020001.md) and the Girl in the Crew is worried about her Colleague because the [Flower](260020000.md) contains some [Poison](100400000.md).

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.28-20:OO on a Shopping-Round <a id="3501"/>
###### Topics: Cigarette, Winston, Ukraine

On the Shopping-Round with my beloved House-Dragon, I meet a Couple from the [Ukraine](140000020.md) and the Man asks me for Fire. After I helped him out, we tried to talk a little bit, but the Conversation was difficult, because they only spoke little English and I never learnt [Ukrainian](666002.md). As Farewell-Present the kind Man hands me over one [Winston](100100002.md)-Cigarette.

## Day-34: Wimbledon, House-Dragon and MPA <a id="3400"/>

BTW, I was wrong with my [last](#3304) [Claim](600078.md) that a Chicken-Curry with two [Hefe-Weizen](203000001.md) without [Alcohol](100100001.md) is 24 Euro, the exact Price AFAIR is currently 22,70 Euro.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.24-15:08 in Tübingen <a id="3110"/>
###### Topics: Chat-GPT, Error

After [Yesterday](#3008)'s Conversation I now register at the [Open-AI](240000008.md)'s Website with my Google-Id and then I try the first Example:

```
Who is Konrad Zuse?
```
```
Konrad Zuse (1910-1995) was a German engineer and computer pioneer who is credited with creating the world's first programmable computer. He began work on his first computer, the Z1, in 1936 while working as an engineer for the Henschel aircraft company in Berlin. The Z1 was completed in 1938 and used binary arithmetic and Boolean logic.

Zuse went on to build several more computers, including the Z2, Z3, and Z4, which were used for scientific and engineering calculations during World War II. His work was largely unknown outside of Germany during the war, but after the conflict ended, Zuse continued to work on computing projects and founded his own computer company, which he ran until his retirement in 1969.

Zuse is considered one of the most important pioneers in the field of computing and his work laid the foundation for the development of modern computers. He was awarded several honors during his lifetime, including the Werner von Siemens Ring in 1964, and is remembered today as a visionary inventor and engineer.
````

Looks like a really good Summary, but at least I found one potential [Error](60074.md), nameley AFIK the [Zuse-Z4](201000004.md) has been completed *after* the World-War-II, so most likely it was not used for Calculations during the War.

###### Topics: Physics

I ask my Neighbor, who is a [Professor](202000005.md) in [Physics](10000000.md), where the [Energy](10000009.md) remains, when two identical [Electro-Magnetic-Waves](10000012.md) with a [Phase-Angle-Shift](10000011.md) of 180 [Angle-Degrees](13000006.md) eliminate each other.

Because as a Result I would expect a [Zero-Wave](404.md) that carries no more Energy, which would violate the [Energy-Conservation-Law](10000017.md).

My Neighbor-Professor has not much Time and just tells me quickly that the Energy is somehow transformed into a different Form. 

To clarify this, I call my Friend Joachim, who is Professor for Mathematics, but also sometimes works in the Physics-Arena. After some Discussion we came to the [Theory](7000001.md), that a Electro-Magnetic-Wave carries/produces two Kinds of "Energy", namely the [Electric-Field](10000013.md) and the [Magnetic-Field](10000014.md).

A "normal" Wave makes both of it, but the resulting Zero-Wave would only produce a Magnetic-Field.

So as I understood it now, when two Waves eliminate each other, their "Electric-Energy" is transformed into "Magnetic-Engergy" and the resulting Zero-Wave has an [Amplitide](10000015.md) of Zero and an infinite [Frequency](10000016.md).

Sounds good, but is that right?
