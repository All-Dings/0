## Day-111: Dussels in Dusslingen <a id="12000"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.09.30-09:15 in Tübingen <a id="12001"/>
###### Topics: Motorbike, Show, Capitalism

Today I have my [Driving-Test](1100000002.md) on the [Motor-Bike](200500003.md), that finally should finish the endless MPA-Story [[0]](#11050). Because I am sure about my [Victory](60144.md), the [Plan](600045.md) is to deliver a little Farewell-[Show](60010003.md) and pass the Test while looking like a real [Dussel](668001.md).

To create a perfect [Illusion](60146.md), already in the [Driving-Lessions](1100000014.md) I have made an Effort to play dumb. And obviously that was so convincing, that after numerous really silly [Failures](60074.md), my [Colleague](180000010.md) in greatest [Despair](10000059.md) even ripped out a heavy [Man-Hole-Cover](1102000002.md) with his bare [Hand](40101030.md):

![Despair in Dusslingen](400000101.jpg)

Fortunately [my](150000005.md) dear [Teacher](202000017.md) organized an [Examiner](202000018.md) with [Humor](40201004.md), who BTW is an Ex-[Soldier](202000020.md) and fittingly carries the same [Name](180000009.md) as the [Males](40000004.md) of our German [Wild-Boars](40210001.md).

First we drive to the Practice-Area near the beautiful [Recycling-Center](1103000002.md) of [Dußlingen](140000062.md), where a young [Bicyclist](1100000011.md) obviously does not give a Shit on our German [Traffic-Signs](1100000003.md):

![Young Dussel](400000098.jpg)

Oh Boy, it's high Time to grow up, really! But back to me: To make it not too obvious for my old Hares, I regularily switch between Wild-Boar- and Pussy-Style, so maximum Accellerations are followed by really slow and broad [U-Turns](1100000009.md).

Then I have to do the Excercises, of which the most dangerous One is called by our [Brave-Viking](150000005.md) just My-[Kyrptonite](750001.md). It looks like the two Traffic-Experts now somehow smelled the Rat and therefore try to test me more accurately.

In the Following they invite me to do the Kyptonite-Test on the Side with the high [Curbs](1100000013.md), this means Kryptonite to the second Power. Of course I stick to my Plan and manage the Test as concise as possible.

To entertain my [Audience](600146.md) a little bit more, on the subsequent Ride to Dußlingen-City I report wordy via [Radio](16000003.md) about my [Plans](600045.md) with the new Bike [[1]](#11051).

Then I see a disabled Foreigner, who obviously does not respect our German [Lines](1100000016.md):

![Disabled Dussel](400000102.jpg)

Come on Boy, high Time to get more fucused, really! But back to me: So far Everything worked according to my [Plan](600045.md), but as we say in good old [German](600004.md):

> The [Devil](647004.md) is known to be a Squirrel [[2]](#11052).

Confident of my [Victory](60144.md) shortly later I overlook a clear [30-Kmh-Zone-Sign](1100000005.md):

![Speed-Limit in Dusslingen](400000099.jpg)

Fortunately my Tester generously forgives my [Speeding-Misdemeanor](670030.md), but the [Joy](10000055.md) about that does not last very long: Seconds later my Gaze completely looses [Focus](60143.md):

![Beauty in Dusslingen](400000103.jpg)

Bad-Luck for me, because I do not check the [Right-for-Left-Rule](1100000007.md) properly and therefore the rutinated Tester has no other Choice than to make me fail the Driving-Test.

Oh Man, obviously this Time I really took it too far and my old Dream of passing all [Tests](60138.md) in my [Life](60064.md) is History now.

Perhaps it is Time for little bit more Discipline:

![Stand still, Soldier!](400000093.jpg)

In case you don't buy the whole Story, stay tuned, soon more about the [The-Truth](600140.md) in the Dings-Project!

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.09.28-17:13 in Tübingen <a id="11002"/>
###### Topics: Motorbike, MPA, Landratsamt

After signing the [Bill](130000002.md) for my last Driving-Lession on the [Motor-Bike](200500003.md), I realize that the [Costs](60082.md) already exceeded 1.600 Euro.

Greetings to my dear [Mrs-N](1000001002.md) from [our](140100002.md) Landratsamt, who told me in best [Swabian-Language](666005.md):

> Dann machen's halt noch schnell den Motorradführerschein neu!

What the Hell, probably I should buy as soon as possible an own [Bike](200500003.md), in Order not to be forced (again) to redo the [Test](60138.md) due to Lack of Driving-Practice.

So Better spend the [Money](6666.md) for Something that is real [Fun](60037.md), in this Sense Greentings to [my](1971091157.md) good old Tractor-Buddy [[0]](#11050) and Biker-Friend [[1]](#11051):

![Thanks Thomas!](400000092.jpg)

###### Topics: Friends, Tennis

After a productive Tennis-Training and a good Meal, I forget my [Tennis-Backpack](270200011.md) at the Bus-Station. Minutes later I realize my Mistake and a one Hour Search in the Vain follows. Finally I surrender and drive back frustrated to [our](1971091101.md) House, where my Neighbours and I witness a real Miracle that was created by [my](1971091156.md) good old Terminator-Buddy [[2]](#10752) and Top-Gun-Friend [[3]](#10753):

![Thanks Giovanni!](400000090.jpg)

## Day-109: Helping Friend with Fun <a id="10900"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.07.24-16:01 at the Kaufland <a id="10901"/>
###### Topics: Friends, Literature

My dear [Artist-Friend](1971091155.md) will probably soon move back to his old Appartment and therefore he asked me, if I could help him with [my](1971091106.md) Car to dispose his empty Bottles, which he collected in the Basement over a longer Period.

At first I am not too keen on the Action, but after we arrived at the [Kaufland](2010027.md) and I see the big Waste-Mountain in our Shopping-Carts, ...

![Our Waste-Mountain](400000048.jpg)

... suddenly the whole Thing looks more like an Adventure to me. I am curious, how much Money we will get out of this and estimate about 30 Euros for the [Deposit](130000029.md).

That was not a really bad Guess, but in case you want to know it exactly, I recommend my [new App](23.md#10901) to unravel the Mystery playfully.

After our "Work" I feel much better and when I report this back to my Friend, he tells me about the "[Tom_Sawyer](730001.md)-Effect", where even the most boring [Work](60036.md) can make [Fun](60037.md) - if you make it smart.

The Story he is referring to is from the Book [The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer](71000004.md), where the crafty Tom managed it to make his Friends paint a big Fence with Pleasure.

But who knows, perhaps the Author [Mark_Twain](70000044.md) would have choosen Nowadays Something like our small Waste-Story instead.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.07.19-10:03 at the Landrats-Amt Tübingen <a id="10701"/>
###### Topics: MPA

I visit my dear [Mrs-N](1000001002.md) at the [Landrats-Amt](140100002.md) and pay the [Money](6666.md) for my new [Driving-License](670014.md):

![Money for Driving](400000043.jpg)

Unfortunately my [MPA-Story](1000001000.md) is still not over yet, because I did not get back my A-License [[0]](#10750) for the [Motor-Bike](200500003.md). The Explanation is that I have not had the Driving-Licence for longer than I have had it.

According to [§](670015.md) 20.2 [[1]](#10751) the Civil-Servants force me to redo the theoretical and the practical [Tests](600103.md), which probably will cost me again around 1.000 Euros.

Although I am a really frustrated about this, I am at least a little bit happy about the partly regained [Freedom](600020.md).

## Day-106: Movies again <a id="10600"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.07.17-13:36 in Tübingen <a id="10602"/>
###### Topics: Movie, Profession

I also can strongly recommend the Movie [The-Suicide-Squad](200040007.md) - at least the first Part. Like we [already](#10601) saw with [The-Orville](200030111.md), also here several [Movie-Genres](200300009.md) are combinded.

But this Time instead of the [Science-Fiction-Genre](270000025.md) the [Super-Hero-Genre](270000027.md) plays the [Root-Tone](90000027.md).

The Special-Effects are really impressive and the [CGI](2000217.md) looks almost real, for Example, when at the End of the [Film](200300000.md) a big Tower collapses into thousands of different Pieces.

Until the middle of the Movie it was extraordinary funny (at least for Adults), but then it gets more serious, which comes a bit suprisingly and IMHO "somehow" does not fit.

Nevertheless it was a great Performance of the whole Crew and BTW I can't remember, if I ever saw such a long List of [Stunt-Men](80000007.md) and [Stunt-Women](80000007.md) in my Life:

![Stunt-Performer List](400000042.jpg)

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.07.17-10:51 in Tübingen <a id="10601"/>
###### Topics: Movie, Star-Trek, Star-Wars

In the last Days I watched the third Season of [The-Orville](200030111.md), which is Part of the [Star-Trek-Universe](200030103.md) that originally was created by [Gene_Roddenberry](70000042.md).

I enjoyed especially the first five Episodes, because they virtuously combine different [Movie-Genres](200300009.md) like [Horror](270000010.md), [Action](270000023.md), [Comedy](270000024.md) and of course [Science-Fiction](270000025.md).

It is striking, that the [Creator](600098.md) [Seth_MacFarlane](70000043.md) has sacrificed some Principles of the good-old [Star-Trek](200030103.md), like scientfic Consistency and Seriousness. For Example, now the [Space-Ships](200600001.md) produce Sounds in the Vacuum similar to [Star-Wars](200035000.md).

In general [Seth_MacFarlane](70000043.md) included also a some other Elements form the Sister-Brand, for Example long Space-Battles or Space-Hunters. Especially in Episode 9 it gets obvious, where we could see a Scene that was copied from the famous Attack of the [X-Wings](200035001.md) on the gigantic [Death-Star](200035002.md).

I really loved the third Season, but what I did not like, was that too many new [Species](40000022.md) appeared without further Explanation and that in the Space-Battles all [Vessels](200600001.md) of the Federation looked like the Orville.

My favourite Character is the [Anroid](9100003.md) [Isaac](200030112.md), who has no Feelings and decides (at least most of the Time) only according the the Rules of [Logic](15000000.md), very much in the Tradition of his Colleagues [Data](200030110.md) and [Spock](200030114.md).

## Day-98: Spinoza and Brass <a id="9800"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.07.01-11:00 in the Klinke <a id="9801"/>
###### Topics: Philosophers-Club, Music

We have two Topics Today at our [Philosphers-Club](2010019.md), namely [Metha-Physics](645004.md) and the [Philospher](202000015.md) [Baruch_de_Spinoza](70000037.md).

Besides Others in the first Part there was discussed the [Theory-of-Ideas](645005.md) founded by [Platon](70000039.md) around 400 BC. The basic Concept is that somewhere exist the abstract [Ideas](600012.md) on how Things *should* be, e.g. the Idea of a round Circle or a perfect Square, but in our Reality we only can come close tho that [Ideal](600015.md). To me this Concept sounded always very plausible.

That also reminds me to many Discussions with my [Jehovah's-Witnesses](647002.md), where they told me that [God](647003.md) makes the [Claim](600028.md) to own the perfect [Ideas](600012.md), how the World should be. The [Devil](647004.md) has a different [Plan](600045.md), but in Principle claims the same. God lets his Counterpart do his bad Work in order to make the [Humans](40000001.md) finally understand, who is right.

The second [Podcast](700050.md) deals with the ideas of [Baruch_de_Spinoza](70000037.md), who was one of the First who claimed that God does not exist as a Person, but instead is an abstract Thing that is in All.

After our Meeting on the Way to the [Kichererbse](2010023.md) we come by a Band of the currently ongoing [Brass-Festival](400000036.md), where I notice an interesting [Instrument](90000020.md), that is called [Sousa-Phone](90000021.md):

![](400000036.jpg)

The Name comes from the [Man](40000004.md) [John_Sousa](70000038.md), who is said to have come up with the Idea for this Instrument. Probably you can make also good Music with such a [Brass](90000022.md), but from the Distance in our Meeting it sounded a bit weird:

## Day-96: Back-Spin, Medicine and Chestnut-Tree <a id="9600"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.29-16:04 on our Way Home <a id="9603"/>
###### Topics: Botanics

On your Way back from the Hospital through the [Tübinger-Botanics-Garden](2010021.md) I got deeply impressed by a beatiful [Chestnut-Tree](260030003.md):

![Castanea sativa Mill.](400000033.jpg)

While decoding the [Latin](640044.md) Name "Castanea sativa Mill.", I ponder about the Meaning of "Mill". The Answer is that a [Man](40000004.md) named [Miller](70000036.md) invented the [Genus](40000024.md) "Castanea".

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.29-14:00 at the UKT <a id="9602"/>
###### Topics: Medicine, My-Fellow-Occupant

After the Tennis-Training I escort my [My-Fellow-Occupant](88.md) to the "Kopfschmerz-Ambulanz" in the [UKT](2010020.md). She reports that the [Triptan](800008.md) which she has been prescribed by the Doctor last Time makes her only sleepy, but it does not help against the [Head-Ache](48000005.md). After the Consultation-Hour, where she had about 99% of the Speaking-Part, the Doctor recommends Magnesium and Vitamin B2.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.29-12:00 at the TCT <a id="9601"/>
###### Topics: Tennis, Music

After a lot of Time on learning the [Top-Spin](270000022.md), Today we finally get acquainted with the [Slice](270000021.md):

![Tennis Back-Spin Training](400000031.mp4)

Afterwards we are invited by [our](70000034.md) European-Champion to a really relaxing Coffee-Break, where I sopontaneously sing together with my [Training-Partner](1971091141.md) a little Duett of [Gute-Nacht-Freunde](90100005.md) from [Reinhard_Mey](70000035.md), that IMHO already sounded quite nice.

Somehow still in Thoughts, I then forget half of the [Work](60036.md), when smoothing the [Tennis-Court](270000018.md):

![My incomplete Work](400000032.jpg)

## Day-95: Tennis-Supports and Land-Restoration <a id="9500"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.28-11:20 at the TCT <a id="9501"/>
###### Topics: Tennis, Land-Restoration

On our weekly Match I manage it to win clearly with 6:0, 6:3 against my 25 Years older [Professor-Friend](1971091140.md). During a break, we address our Ignorance of whether the [Net-Supports](270000016.md) are used for Single- or Double-Matches:

![Single-Net-Supports](400000029.jpg)

Fourtunately [H.O](70000032.md) is there, who at the Moment gives Tennis-Lessons on the neighbouring Court and then tells us that those are used for Single-Matches.

Because we shoot a Ball outside the Court, after the Match I had to enter the Construction-Site, where currently [Land-Restoration](260030002.md) is done for the [Neckar](140000048.md):

## Day-91: Freiburg Concert <a id="9100"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.24-19:30 in Freiburg <a id="9101"/>
###### Topics: Choir, Wann?

Today our [Ernst-Bloch-Chor](2010013.md) has its last Concert with Songs from the "Heimat-Program". We perform together with the [SUSI-Chor](90001005.md) in [Freiburg](140000047.md) under the Headline "Eine andere Welt ist möglich".

IMHO both [Choirs](90001000.md) delivered a really good Preformance and especially regarding the Dynamics [we](2010013.md) reached our Maximum.

The Event is located in the "Bürgerhaus Seepark", which is beautifully situated on a Lake:

![](400000025.jpg)

Suitable for the Evening's Topic the two Choirs together present the Song "[Wann?](400000027.md)" from [Rio_Reiser](70000030.md), that I also recorded last Year for my "Project Heimat" [[0]](#9102) according to the [Choral-Set](91001006.md) made by [Ansgar_Rettner](70000031.md):

###### Topics: Tennis, Wimbledon

After the Tennis-Match with my Colleague and a good Meal at the [Delhi-Palace](18071962.md), I play the first [Mixed-Double](270000014.md) together with my [Wimbledon-Win-Friend](1971091141.md). Although it is only a Fun-Match, I really want to find out, how strong we are as a [Team](180000006.md) and therefore I act very focused.

As a Result we win clearly in two [Sets](270200007.md). But afterwards I get the Impression that the [Mood](14000002.md) of all four Protagonists is not the very best. Maybe also because especially the [Serves](270000015.md) have been quite disappointing.

But at least we are now one Step further on our Roadmap to [Wimbledon](270200009.md) and BTW, Today we experimented already with our joint Outfit in Blue.

Style is important, no Question, but first of all probably a little bit more [Training](600100.md) is required:

After I came back from Stuttgart [Yesterday](#8900), I left [My-Bicycle](1971091105.md) at the Train-Station and Today on my Way to a [Tennis-Match](270000012.md) with my Tenor-Colleague I want to pick it up again. When I arrive at my Baby, I realize that Someone has stolen my Tools:

Assuming that my World is a bit worse now and for the Person, who commited the [Thievery](670013.md), the World is a bit better, regarding [my](#7001) recent Definition of [Moral](645003.md) the global Result is equal - nevertheless it feels somehow wrong.

## Day-89: Diablo IV <a id="8900"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.22-22:31 in Tübingen <a id="8901"/>
###### Topics: Psychology, Computer-Games

Because of a Depression the last Days have been really painful and I barely left the Bed. Fortunately I bought the new Computer-Game [Diablo-IV](280000006.md):

![Diabolo-IV in the Bed](400000018.jpg)

As a big [Hero](60020003.md) in my Fight for [The-Good](60120.md) I kill thousands of [Monsters](60020001.md). My dangerous Opponent is [Lilith](280000008.md), who is the evil [Daughter](40000009.md) of the perhaps even more evil [Mephisto](280000009.md).

The Name of the [Dark-Lady](60020004.md) reminds me to the [Lilith-Computer](201000005.md) that was created by the Computer-[Legend](70000000.md) [Niklaus_Wirth](70000028.md). He once told me that he never was a big Fighter, so he probably would not have liked the quite violent Computer-Game very much.

The same as my [Father](40000007.md), who at least would have enjoyed the really beatiful Computer-Graphics with this [Grey-Heron](260010005.md) I recently met in the Swamps:

![Grey-Heron in Diabolo-IV](400000019.jpg)

Today is my first Day I feel better, so I visited [Nicole](1997080300.md) in Stuttgart again, where we bought a [Playstation](201000006.md)-5 for also playing Computer-Games with her Son:

## Day-76: MPA-Plan for Cologne <a id="7600"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.09-21:52 in Tübingen <a id="7601"/>
###### Topics: MPA

Today I came up with the following [Strategy](160000000.md) for my fifth [MPA](1000001001.md) in [Cologne](140000026.md):

- I will again present the "best" Testimonies, which should prove that I normally don't drink and drive.
- The Talk to "Stefan" changed my Mind: I see now that I had an [Alcohol](100100006.md)-Problem and therefore decided to abstain completely now, also because in the Time without that [Drug](100100001.md), I felt much better.
- Almost one and a half Years of Abstinence should be Prove enough, that I am able to do this.
- For the very unlikely Case that this does not work, I can still point out, that also with Alcohol I was able to separate Dinking from Driving (see Testimonies).
- Especially after the whole painful and expensive MPA-Torture, as a Burnt-Child I will prevent similar Incidents in the Future under all Circumstances.

Sounds like a good Plan?

In the Night I watch together with my dear Friend "Sarah" and my beloved [House-Dragon](1971091142.md) one of our favourite Movies [Back-to-the-Future](200040006.md).

I always identfied myself a little bit with the Main-Actor [Michael_J_Fox](70000025.md), who unfortunately suffers under [Parkinson](48000014.md) since a long Time.

And of course I love the crazy Scientist "Doc Brown" played by [Christopher_Loyed](70000026.md) and admire [Crispin_Glover](50000028.md) for his brilliant Acting-Performance, when impersonating the shy Looser-Type "George McFly".

Last but not least I would like to mention the Sound-Track with the great Song [The-Power-of-Love](90100003.md) from [Huey_Lewis](70000027.md).

## Day-71: Movie "2 Fast 2 Furious" <a id="7100"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.04-00:00 in Tübingen <a id="7101"/>
###### Topics: Movie, English

After finishing Day-70, I watch the [2-Fast-2-Furious](200040004.md), which is the second [Movie](200300000.md) of the [Fast-and-Furious-Series](200040002.md). Compared to the [The-Fast-and-The-Furious](200040003.md) I like it better.

The Team of the white [Paul_Walker](70000020.md) with his steel-blue [Eyes](40101001.md) and the black [Tyrese_Gibson](70000023.md) reminded me a little bit to [Terrence_Hill](70000021.md) and [Bud_Spencer](70000022.md), although IMHO compared to Paul, Terrence is the better Actor.

Somehow I missed [Vin_Diesel](70000024.md), who was Part of the first two Episodes that I have seen so far.

I watched the Movie in [English](600006.md) and found it quite hard (again) to understand the [American-English](640042.md), especially spoken by [Tyrese](70000023.md). The Accent of [Paul](70000020.md) sounds more like aristocratic [British-English](640043.md), which is much easier for me.

## Day-70: About Moral <a id="7000"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.03-22:01 in Tübingen <a id="7002"/>
###### Topics: Philosophics, AI

After all I made the Decision to add my (under Circumstances wrong) Definition to All-Dings and also asked [Chat-GPT](9000150.md), how it would define this Concept, so "Chat-GPT: Define the Term Moral!":

> Moral refers to the principles, values, and beliefs that guide and influence individuals or societies in distinguishing right from wrong and in determining what is good or bad. It is a system of ethical principles and standards that shape and govern human behavior and interactions.
>
> Moral frameworks vary across cultures, religions, and philosophical perspectives, but they often include fundamental principles such as honesty, fairness, compassion, integrity, respect for others, and the promotion of well-being. Morality provides a foundation for individuals to make judgments about the consequences and ethical implications of their _actions_.
>
> Moral reasoning involves the ability to assess and evaluate the morality of a situation or _decision_, considering factors such as intentions, consequences, rights, and duties. It involves understanding and applying ethical principles and norms to guide behavior and make choices that align with one's moral values.

Not bad at all, isn't it? Well at least it also used the Terms "Decisions" and "Actions" as I did in my Definition respectively Python-Program. 

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.06.03-11:00 in Tübingen <a id="7001"/>
###### Topics: Philosophics

Today I visit the [Philosophers-Club](2010019.md) in the [Klinke](2010018.md), where we always hear Contributions to diverse Questions of [Philosophics](645000.md). This Time we choose a Podcast that discusses the Topic [Moral](645003.md).

The Speaker means that in his Opinion [Definitions](13000002.md) are mostly either trivial or wrong. I still hope that this is not true and I have already several concrete Proposals for defining that complicated Thing.

For Example, something like "Moral is a [Measure](10000021.md) for [Decisions](60095.md) to achieve a [Goal](60058.md)". Here a Proposal for a [Pyhthon](9010003.md)-Program to calculate this Measure:

```python
def Profit(Person, Descision)
    World_1 = World(Current)
    Value_1 = World_1.Get_Value_For(Person)
    World_2 = World_1.Do_Actions(Person, Decision)
    Value_2 = World_2.Get_Value_For(Person)
    return Value_2 - Value_1

def Measure_Moral():
    Profit_Sum = 0
    for Ding in All_Dings.List:
        Profit_Sum += Profit(Ding, Ding.Next_Decision())
    return Profit_Sum
```

But this Definition might be wrong, so as a Decision for the Time being let's formulate it trivial, but at least correct:

```
Moral is a Concept in Philosophics.
```

BTW, I called our Meeting "Philosophers-Club", because this is the Term I personally use most often. But the official Name is [Philosophie verständlich gemacht](2010019.md) and other Crew-Members call it also simply [Philo-Kurs](2010019.md).

After the disillusioning Phone-Call with the Amts-Gericht I feel more at the Mercy of the German-System than ever before and my [Depression](48000012.md) that I already had for several Days gets even worse.

On a Walking-Round I thought about my Options and I come up with the Idea of reading the Book [Urteils-Bildung-in-der-Fahreignungs-Begutachtung](1000001009.md).

In all four Expertises this Book has been used as Justification for the negative Assessments:

Die Bedingungen nach den Beurteilungskriterien, Urteilsbildung in der Fahreignungsbegutachtung,

For References in my planned Analyis I first create a digital Version of the analog Print:

I explain the Facts of the Case to a friendly Woman, who then tells me that she first needs to do a bit more Research on this Topic. I should first send her the last MPA-[Expert-Report](700043.md) and then she wants to contact me Tomorrow again.

What I also learnt from her, is that beginning with a [Dispute-Value](670010.md) of 5.000,- Euro the [Legal-Proceeding](670011.md) will be done by a [Land-Gericht](680002.md) and no longer by the [Amts-Gericht](680001.md).

###### Topics: Economics, Double-Standards

Had a longer Talk to the Owner of [my](2010008.md) Butcher-Shop, where he told me some Thories about the current [Inflation](60062.md). In his Opinion the Problem is that the [Trading-Companies](130020001.md) seize the Opportunity and charge excessive [Prices](130000012.md). Obviously only little of the Money reaches the Bottom and while some People earn themself a golden Nose the [Producing-Companies](130000018.md) get into Trouble.

This [Stratgy](160000000.md) seems to work, because there are still enough wealthy People, who are willing pay the high Prices.

After I noted, that that sounds like [Fraud](41010002.md) to me, he did not deny it and asked the interesting Question, why the [Bundes-Kartell-Amt](8020001.md) obviously is doing nothing against that.

Finally he told me a little Story about the Calibration-Office, which obviously created a lot of Stress because of a minimal Deviation in his Scale. On the other Hand it is common Knowledge, that on the [Canstadter-Wasen](270000007.md) the Beer-Glases are rarely full.

This confirms my Suspicion that in our Society more and more [Double-Standards](41010003.md) are applied and then the Small-People have to spoon out the Soup.

I ask myself, why I am so focused on having [Success](60108.md) with my Project and was reminded to an Interview with [Kurt_Tepperwein](70000018.md), where he gave the Advise to make your [Life](60064.md) unique somehow.

One common [Pattern](60112.md) for reaching this [Goal](60058.md) is to use [Competition](600094.md), e.g. who makes the best Pizza or who invents the best Programming-Language.

I liked this Season because of the really great [Special-Effects](200300008.md) and the exciting [Story](60109.md), even if Sometimes [Logic](600038.md) has been sacrificed for Simplicity.

And of course the Best is, that almost all [Star-Trek-NG](200350100.md) Heroes have been on Board again, e.g. besides of [Captain_Picard](200030105.md) my Favorites have been [Seven-of-Nine](200030106.md), [Worf](200030108.md) and of course the [Geordi_La_Forge](200030109.md) and his [Android](200400004.md)-Friend [Data](200030110.md).

IMHO all of them are even better than in their younger Days, especially [Michael_Dorn](70000017.md), the [Actor](202000010.md) of [Worf]200030108.md) made a huge Step forward.

###### Topics: AI

After [Yesterday](#3008)'s Conversation I now register at the [Open-AI](240000008.md)'s Website with my Google-Id and then I try the first Example:

```
Who is Konrad Zuse?
```
```
Konrad Zuse (1910-1995) was a German engineer and computer pioneer who is credited with creating the world's first programmable computer. He began work on his first computer, the Z1, in 1936 while working as an engineer for the Henschel aircraft company in Berlin. The Z1 was completed in 1938 and used binary arithmetic and Boolean logic.

Zuse went on to build several more computers, including the Z2, Z3, and Z4, which were used for scientific and engineering calculations during World War II. His work was largely unknown outside of Germany during the war, but after the conflict ended, Zuse continued to work on computing projects and founded his own computer company, which he ran until his retirement in 1969.

Zuse is considered one of the most important pioneers in the field of computing and his work laid the foundation for the development of modern computers. He was awarded several honors during his lifetime, including the Werner von Siemens Ring in 1964, and is remembered today as a visionary inventor and engineer.
```

Looks like a really good Summary, but at least I found one potential [Error](60074.md), nameley AFIK the [Zuse-Z4](201000004.md) has been completed *after* the World-War-II, so most likely it was not used for Calculations during the War.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.11-14:OO in the Philosophen-Weg <a id="1804"/>
###### Topics: Physics

I ask my Neighbor, who is a [Professor](202000005.md) in [Physics](10000000.md), where the [Energy](10000009.md) remains, when two identical [Electro-Magnetic-Waves](10000012.md) with a [Phase-Angle-Shift](10000011.md) of 180 [Angle-Degrees](13000006.md) eliminate each other.

Because as a Result I would expect a [Zero-Wave](404.md) that carries no more Energy, which would violate the [Energy-Conservation-Law](10000017.md).

My Neighbor-Professor has not much Time and just tells me quickly that the Energy is somehow transformed into a different Form. 

To clarify this, I call my Friend Joachim, who is Professor for Mathematics, but also sometimes works in the Physics-Arena. After some Discussion we came to the [Theory](7000001.md), that a Electro-Magnetic-Wave carries/produces two Kinds of "Energy", namely the [Electric-Field](10000013.md) and the [Magnetic-Field](10000014.md).

A "normal" Wave makes both of it, but the resulting Zero-Wave would only produce a Magnetic-Field.

So as I understood it now, when two Waves eliminate each other, their "Electric-Energy" is transformed into "Magnetic-Engergy" and the resulting Zero-Wave has an [Amplitide](10000015.md) of Zero and an infinite [Frequency](10000016.md).

Sounds good, but is that right?
