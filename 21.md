## Day-32: xxx <a id="3200"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.24-16:02 in Tübingen <a id="3201"/>
###### Topics: Smoking-Study

I have the Feeling that without [Cigarettes](100100002.md) I need more [Sleep](60068.md) and also my Ability to concentrate suffered. This supports the [Thesis](600028.md) that [Nicotine](100000002.md) is a [Stimulant-Drug](100100005.md).

## Day-31: Chat-GPT <a id="3100"/>

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.24-15:08 in Tübingen <a id="3110"/>
###### Topics: Chat-GPT, Error

After [Yesterday](#3008)'s Conversation I now register at the [Open-AI](240000008.md)'s Website with my Google-Id and then I try the first Example:

```
Who is Konrad Zuse?
```
```
Konrad Zuse (1910-1995) was a German engineer and computer pioneer who is credited with creating the world's first programmable computer. He began work on his first computer, the Z1, in 1936 while working as an engineer for the Henschel aircraft company in Berlin. The Z1 was completed in 1938 and used binary arithmetic and Boolean logic.

Zuse went on to build several more computers, including the Z2, Z3, and Z4, which were used for scientific and engineering calculations during World War II. His work was largely unknown outside of Germany during the war, but after the conflict ended, Zuse continued to work on computing projects and founded his own computer company, which he ran until his retirement in 1969.

Zuse is considered one of the most important pioneers in the field of computing and his work laid the foundation for the development of modern computers. He was awarded several honors during his lifetime, including the Werner von Siemens Ring in 1964, and is remembered today as a visionary inventor and engineer.
````

Looks like a really good Summary, but at least I found one potential [Error](60074.md), nameley AFIK the [Zuse-Z4](201000004.md) has been completed *after* the World-War-II, so most likely it was not used for Calculations during the War.

Had a loud Dispute with my Flat-Mate, because I bought the "wrong" Din-A4 [Envelopes](205000001.md). Although she has A4-Documents, they are difficult to fit into the "Container" with the same Size. Therefore I go to our [Post-Office](200020001.md) and buy some slightly bigger Din-B4 Envelopes. But I still wonder, which Documents should be put into the Din-A4 Envelopes?

###### Topics: Technology, All-Dings

I meet a [Mother](40000008.md) with her young [Daughter](40000009.md) riding a Fun-Pro-Scooter. We first discussed the [Technology](60044.md) of this [Vehicle](200500000.md) and afterwards I briefly showed her my Project. At the End she says that she would call that a [Hobby](60045.md), which then reminds me that I should define the Meaning of [Work](60036.md) a bit more.

#### Blog-Chain-Time 2023.04.11-14:OO in the Philosophen-Weg <a id="1804"/>
###### Topics: Physics

I ask my Neighbor, who is a [Professor](202000005.md) in [Physics](10000000.md), where the [Energy](10000009.md) remains, when two identical [Electro-Magnetic-Waves](10000012.md) with a [Phase-Angle-Shift](10000011.md) of 180 [Angle-Degrees](13000006.md) eliminate each other.

Because as a Result I would expect a [Zero-Wave](404.md) that carries no more Energy, which would violate the [Energy-Conservation-Law](10000017.md).

My Neighbor-Professor has not much Time and just tells me quickly that the Energy is somehow transformed into a different Form. 

To clarify this, I call my Friend Joachim, who is Professor for Mathematics, but also sometimes works in the Physics-Arena. After some Discussion we came to the [Theory](7000001.md), that a Electro-Magnetic-Wave carries/produces two Kinds of "Energy", namely the [Electric-Field](10000013.md) and the [Magnetic-Field](10000014.md).

A "normal" Wave makes both of it, but the resulting Zero-Wave would only produce a Magnetic-Field.

So as I understood it now, when two Waves eliminate each other, their "Electric-Energy" is transformed into "Magnetic-Engergy" and the resulting Zero-Wave has an [Amplitide](10000015.md) of Zero and an infinite [Frequency](10000016.md).

Sounds good, but is that right?
