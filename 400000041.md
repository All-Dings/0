## Observations

- The [Root-Tones](90000027.md) of both have a [Frequency](10000016.md) of around 350 Hz, where the Tone-Ü is slightly higher than Tone-U.
- The [Over-Tones](90000031.md) are Multiples of the Root-Tone and for higher Tones the Differences between Tone-U and Tone-Ü get bigger.
- The first Over-Tone with around 700 Hz is has a higher [Amplitide](10000015.md) for Tone-U which might be the Reason why this Tone sounds deeper.
