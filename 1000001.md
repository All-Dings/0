# Blog-Chain-Time

In this Project inside Text Documents we use the so called Blog-Chain-Time or in short BCT.

Example:
```
Blog-Chain-Time 2023.03.28-22:35 in TÃ¼bingen, After Micha and I ...
```

## Timestamp Format

Timestamps are specified as follows: YYYY.MM.DD-HH:MM:SS,F

- YYYY: Year
- MM: Month
- DD: Day
- HH: Hour
- MM: Minute
- SS: Second
- F: Decimal Fraction of a Second

For Example the 4th of April 2021 at 11pm, 4 minutes, 10 seconds and 91 Milliseconds is written as:

```
2021.04.04
2021.04.04-23:04
2021.04.04-23:04:10
2021.04.04-23:04:10,091
```

If the Date is not required, specify only the Time:
```
23:04
23:04:10
23:04:10,091
```

If some Elements of the TimeStamp are not known, the Character 'O' (like Open) is used to mark the uncertain Parts.

```
OOOO.04.OO
20OO.04.OO
2021.04.OO
2021.04.04-OO:OO
```

## Standard Time Zone

Specify Date and Time in German (Central European) Time according to the current Summer/Daylight Time.

For Example let's say something happens in Germany at 2023.03.26 at 1:58 (Winter Time):

```
2023.03.26-01:58 Something interesting happened
```

If three Minutes later another thing happens you have to write:
```
2023.03.26-03:01 More interesting things happened
