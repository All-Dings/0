# All-Dings-Rules

Some Rules for this Project. And of course also this Document follows those (BTW).

## Blog-Chain-Time

Everytime, when Time and Date is important, we use the [Blog-Chain-Time](1000001.md) to specify the ordering of Events in a reasonable Way. 

## Take Care of Number-Files <a id="1000"/>

The Meaning of Number-Files should not be changed, because otherwise [References](60039.md) will break.

## Upper-, Lower- and Mixed-Case

Subjectives and Names are written in Upper-Case:

```
Clash of Clans is a really nice Game!
```
## Dashes

For long words with more than one part Dashes are used e.g. this English Word is really hard to read:

```
Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
```

At least for me this is much easier:

```
Pneumonoul-Tramicros-Copic-Silico-Volcano-Coniosis
```

## Meaningful goes first

In Germany there is a saying "Keine Regel ohne Ausnahme".

## Some Bugs are allowed

Also this document will always contain at least one bug ;-)

## Image Format

- Size: Full-HD (1920 Pixel at longer Side)
- Type: jpg

## Sorting

Sort Text, e.g. Headings alphabetically.
