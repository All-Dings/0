# Rules

Some Rules for this Project. And of course also this Document follows those (BTW).

## Upper-, Lower- and HolyCase

Subjectives and Names are written in UpperCase:

```
Clash of Clans is a really nice Game!
```

For long words with more than one part MixedCase is used, you can call it also HolyCase.

This English Word is really hard to read:

```
Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
```

At least for me this is much easier:

```
PneumonoulTramicrosCopicSilicoVolcanoConiosis
```

## Meaningful goes first

In Germany there is a saying "Keine Regel ohne Ausnahme". And the first heading demonstrates this (see Rule below).

## Some Bugs are allowed

Also this document will always contain at least one bug ;-)

## Date and Time

### Format

Timestamps are specified as follows: YYYY.MM.DD-HH:MM:SS,F

- YYYY: Year
- MM: Month
- DD: Day
- SS: Second
- F: Decimal Fraction of a Second

For Example the 4th of April 2021 at 11pm, 4 minutes, 10 seconds and 91 Milliseconds is written as:

```
2021.04.04
2021.04.04-23:04
2021.04.04-23:04:10
2021.04.04-23:04:10,091
```

If the Date is not required, specify only the Time:
```
23:04
23:04:10
23:04:10,091
```

If some Parts of the TimeStamp are not known, QuestionMarks are used for the unknown Parts:

```
????.04.??
20??.04.??
2021.04.??
2021.04.04-??:??
```

### Standard Time Zone

Specify Date and Time in German (Central European) Time according to the current Summer/Daylight Time.

For Example let's say something happens in Germany at 2023.03.26 at 1:58 (Winter Time):

```
2023.03.26-01:58 Something interesting happened
```

If three Minutes later another thing happens you have to write:
```
2023.03.26-03:01 More interesting things happened
```
