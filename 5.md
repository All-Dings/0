# Rules

Some Rules for this Project. And of course also this Document follows those (BTW).

## Blog-Chain-Time

Everytime, when Time and Date is important, we use the [Blog-Chain-Time](1000001.md) to specify the ordering of Events in a reasonable Way. 

## Upper-, Lower- and MixedCase

Subjectives and Names are written in UpperCase:

```
Clash of Clans is a really nice Game!
```

For long words with more than one part MixedCase is used, you can call it also HolyCase, if you really want.

This English Word is really hard to read:

```
Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
```

At least for me this is much easier:

```
PneumonoulTramicrosCopicSilicoVolcanoConiosis
```

## Meaningful goes first

In Germany there is a saying "Keine Regel ohne Ausnahme". And the first heading demonstrates this (see Rule below).

## Some Bugs are allowed

Also this document will always contain at least one bug ;-)

## Image Format

- Size: Full-HD (1920 Pixel at longer Side)

## Sorting
