# Dings_Rules

Some Rules for this Project. And of course also this Document follows those (BTW).

## Blog_Chain_Time

Everytime, when Time and Date is important, we use the [Blog_Chain_Time](1000001.md) to specify the ordering of Events in a reasonable Way. 

## Take Care of Number_Files <a id="1000"/>

The Name of a [Number_File](300000010.md) may change, but the [Meaning](60002.md) should not be changed, because otherwise [References](60039.md) will break.

## Upper-, Lower- and Mixed_Case

Subjectives and Names are written in Upper_Case:

```
Clash of Clans is a really nice Game!
```
## Dashes

For long words with more than one part Dashes are used e.g. this English Word is really hard to read:

```
Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
```

At least for me this is much easier:

```
Pneumonoul_Tramicros_Copic_Silico_Volcano_Coniosis
```

## Meaningful goes first

In Germany there is a saying "Keine Regel ohne Ausnahme".

## Some Errors are allowed <a id="1001"/>

Also this document will always contain at least one bug ;-)

## Image Format

- Size: Full_HD (1920 Pixel at longer Side)
