# Zero-Wave-Device-Patent <a id="1000"/>

The Zero-Wave-Device-Patent is a [Dings-Patent](300000030.md) of [Michael_Holzheu](0.md).

Status: <font color="red">Draft</font>

## Abstract <a id="1600"/>

This Patent describes the [Zero-Wave-Device](20000021.md), that is able to generate [Heating](10000072.md) or [Cooling](10000073.md) by using all Kinds of [Waves](60156.md).

## Theory <a id="1100"/>

When two [Waves](60156.md) with 180 Degree [Phase-Shift](10000079.md) create a [Superposition](10000065.md), the [Result](60033.md) is a [Zero-Wave](10000061.md):

While the Zero-Wave is created, the Energy of the two Partner-Waves is released:

Depending on [The-Truth](600140.md) of the [Zero-Wave-Theory](301000002.md), a [Transformation](600164.md) of the released [Wave-Energy](10000080.md) is carried out either into [Thermal-Energy](10000070.md) or [Zero-Energy](10000071.md).

In the former Case [Heating](10000072.md) is generated, in the Latter [Cooling](10000073.md) is the [Result](60033.md).

## Invention <a id="1200"/>

The [Zero-Wave-Device](20000021.md) has the [Ability](600103.md) for generating [Pro-Waves](10000082.md) and [Anti-Waves](10000081.md), but also already existing [Environment-Waves](301000003.md) can be used, therefore in total we have three different Modes:

- Stand-Alone-Mode
- Add-On-Mode
- Modulation-Mode

### Stand-Alone-Mode <a id="1201"/>

Both, the [Pro-Wave](10000082.md) and [Anti-Wave](10000081.md) is created by the Device:

### Add-On-Mode <a id="1202"/>

An artificial [Anti-Wave](10000081.md) is created for an already existing [Environment-Wave](301000003.md):

### Modulation-Mode <a id="1203"/>

Use two [Environment-Waves](301000003.md) and perform a [Transformation](600164.md) into fitting Wave-Pairs using [Frequency-Modulation](10000089.md), [Phase-Modulation](10000092.md) and [Amplitude-Modulation](10000090.md):

## Wave-Forms <a id="1300"/>

For this Invention all Kind of Waves can be used, for Example:

- [Light-Waves](10000012.md)
- [Sound-Waves](40200001.md)
- [Water-Waves](10000084.md)
- [Wind-Waves](10000083.md)

## Use-Cases <a id="1400"/>

### Main Use-Case <a id="1410"/>

The main [Use-Case](600170.md) for the [Zero-Wave-Device](20000021.md) is [Heating](10000072.md) or [Cooling](10000073.md).

### Other Benefits <a id="1420"/>

- Reduce [Noise-Pollution](290000001.md) with [Anti-Sound](10000066.md).
- Reduce [Light-Pollution](290000003.md) with [Anti-Light](10000087.md).
- Solve the [Global-Warming](290000002.md) Problem.
