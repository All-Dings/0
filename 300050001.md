# Zero-Wave-Device-Patent <a id="1000"/>

Status: <font color="red">Draft</font>

## Theory <a id="1100"/>

When two [Waves](60156.md) with 180 Degree [Phase-Shift](10000079.md) create a [Superposition](10000065.md), the [Result](60033.md) is a [Zero-Wave](10000061.md):

While the Zero-Wave is created, the Energy of the two Partner-Waves is released:

Depending on [The-Truth](600140.md) of the [Zero-Wave-Theory](301000002.md), a [Transformation](600164.md) of the released [Wave-Energy](10000080.md) is carried out either into [Thermal-Energy](10000070.md) or [Zero-Energy](10000071.md).

In the former Case [Heating](10000072.md) is generated, in the Latter [Cooling](10000073.md) is the [Result](60033.md).

## Invention <a id="1200"/>

The [Zero-Wave-Device](20000021.md) has the [Ability](600103.md) for generating fitting [Original-Waves](10000082.md) and [Anti-Waves](10000081.md) by applying the following Mechanisms:

- Use existing Waves of the Environment and artificially create fitting Anti-Waves for them
- Use existing Waves of the Environment and transfrom them into fitting Wave-Pairs
- Artificially create the complete Wave-Pair

The third Method is visualized in the following Drawing:

## Wave-Forms <a id="1300"/>

For this Invention all Kind of Waves can be used, for Example:

- [Electro-Magnetic-Waves](10000012.md)
- [Sound-Waves](40200001.md)
- [Water-Waves](10000084.md)
- [Wind-Waves](10000083.md)

## Use-Cases <a id="1400"/>

### Main Use-Case <a id="1410"/>

Depending on the Results of the [Zero-Wave-Theory](301000002.md) the main [Use-Case](600163.md) for the [Zero-Wave-Device](20000021.md) is [Heating](10000072.md) or [Cooling](10000073.md).

### Other Benefits <a id="1420"/>

- Reduce [Noise-Pollution](400000001.md) with [Anti-Sound](10000066.md)
- Reduce [Light-Pollution](400000004.md) with [Anti-Light](10000087.md)
- Solve the [Global-Warming](400000002.md) Problem.
